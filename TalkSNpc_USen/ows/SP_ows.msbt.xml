Long ago and far away<tag a="110" b="0" />
The gods were enjoying a fantastical
banquet by a river <anim id="Shocked" target="actor" targetSpec="" />when the terrible
monster Typhon appeared!
<anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Unprepared as they were for a fight,<delay20 />
the gods assumed various animal
shapes and fled with all speed.
<anim id="Restless" target="actor" targetSpec="" />But Pan, the goatish god of
shepherds, jumped into the river,<delay20 />
transforming as he did so.
<anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Perhaps because he was so shocked,
he did not finish changing himself
into a fish <anim id="Oops" target="actor" targetSpec="" />and only changed his tail.
<anim id="Serious" target="actor" targetSpec="" />The chief god, Zeus, was highly
amused at the sight of a goatfish
and hung the image in the stars.
<anim id="Worried" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I feel sort of bad for Pan in that
story, <delay20 />having a constellation based

<anim id="Blushing" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It would be a bit like someone

Zeus, in the form of a great eagle,
<anim id="Aha" target="actor" targetSpec="" />spotted an astonishingly handsome

Zeus hung the cupbearer's image in

<anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />As the gods ran, <delay20 />Aphrodite tied
herself to her son Eros with a rope
so that they wouldn't be separated.
They then turned into fish and fled,<delay20 /><anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />
which is why Pisces is often depicted
as two fish connected by a rope.
<anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />While I enjoy that story,<delay20 /><anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> it does leave
unexplored one detail about which I
am terribly curious...
<anim id="QuestionMark" target="actor" targetSpec="" />How did the vain Aphrodite react on

<anim id="Worried" target="actor" targetSpec="" />When one of the queen's schemes
put the twins' lives in peril, their
mother prayed to Zeus for help.
<anim id="Aha" target="actor" targetSpec="" />A flying sheep with golden fleece
descended from the heavens and
rescued the twins!
<anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Zeus commemorated the event by
hanging the image of the sheep in
the stars as the constellation Aries.
<anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Did you notice how Zeus celebrates

with her servants by the sea.
<anim id="Hello" target="actor" targetSpec="" />She was approached by a lovely
white bull that seemed <10_5 />very<endTag a="10" b="5" /> friendly,<delay20 />
so Europa hopped on its back.
<anim id="Shocked" target="actor" targetSpec="" />As she did so, however, the bull
suddenly took off,<delay20 /> dashing across
the ocean in a most unbull-like way.
<anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />The bull,<delay20 /> it turned out,<delay20 /><anim id="Aha" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> was the god
Zeus, who had fallen for Europa<tag a="110" b="0" /><delay frames="40" /><anim id="Oops" target="actor" targetSpec="" />
but had trouble with boundaries.
<anim id="FaintSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />The constellation Taurus honors the
great bull, <delay20 />and Europa herself has a
whole continent named for her!
But<delay20 /> continent names aside,<delay20 /><anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> I imagine
Europa would have preferred it if
Zeus simply asked her to tea.</message>

Long ago and far away<tag a="110" b="0" />
<anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />The great god Zeus had twin sons
named Castor and Pollux, <delay20 />who were
both brave warriors.
While the brothers were very close
and alike in many ways, <delay20 /><anim id="Worried" target="actor" targetSpec="" />only Pollux
had inherited Zeus's immortality.
When Castor eventually died, <delay20 /><anim id="BrokenHeart" target="actor" targetSpec="" />the
grieving Pollux prayed to share
his immortality with his brother.
<anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Zeus took pity and turned the twins
into the constellation Gemini<delay20 /><anim id="FaintSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> so
they would always be together.
<anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I suppose the lesson of this story is
that, <delay20 />occasionally,<delay20 /> even Zeus does
something for someone else.</message>

Hydra poisoning a spring that was

<anim id="FaintSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />When the great hero Heracles
heard about this, <delay20 />he set out to
rid the land of the beast.
<anim id="Worried" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Just as Heracles was about to land
the finishing blow, <delay20 />the Hydra's
friend, a crab, arrived to help it out.

<anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />There was a mighty lion with
unbreakable skin that menaced
the forest of Nemea.
The great hero Heracles<delay20 /> fought the
beast<anim id="Surprised" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> and defeated it with nothing
but his incredible strength!
<anim id="Serious" target="actor" targetSpec="" />The goddess Hera placed the lion
in the stars as the constellation Leo
to honor its fight with the hero.
<anim id="Silent" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I'm not usually one to gossip, <delay frames="40" />but I

Demeter was the goddess of the

all the crops stopped growing!
<anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Eventually mother and child were
reunited, <delay20 /><anim id="Oops" target="actor" targetSpec="" />but only for part of each

<anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />The constellation Virgo is depicted
as a young woman holding wheat
in honor of this story.
<anim id="Scheming" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Between you and me,<delay20 /> I think Demeter
was suffering from what we call
"empty-nest syndrome."</message>

them<tag a="110" b="0" /><delay frames="40" />until Pandora opened the box

<anim id="AbsentMindedness" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I guess someone thought they were

Long ago and far away<tag a="110" b="0" />
<anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />There was a very skilled hunter
named Orion who boasted often
of his abilities.
Orion's arrogance angered the gods,<delay20 /><anim id="TakenAback" target="actor" targetSpec="" />
who sent a poisonous scorpion to
sting him to death.
<anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />The goddess Artemis, who had
always been fond of Orion, <anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />arranged
for him to become a constellation.
But he still feared scorpions, which
is <anim id="IdeaBulb" target="actor" targetSpec="" />why his constellation and Scorpio
are never seen together.
<anim id="SmugFace" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Personally, I try to learn from this
tale by being humble about my skills
