preparations for the fireworks
show tonight. <delay20 /><anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It starts at 7 PM sharp!
<anim id="QuestionMark" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Have you heard that we're planning
to display custom fireworks during
tonight's presentation as well?</message>
	<message label="002" attrib="00 00 00 00"><anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It's still early, <delay8 />so there's quite a bit
of time left before the fireworks
show begins.
<anim id="Serious" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Make sure to finish all your errands
while it's still light out. <delay20 /><anim id="BigSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />You won't
want to miss one minute of the show.</message>
	<message label="003" attrib="00 00 00 00"><anim id="AbsentMindedness" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I'm counting down the seconds until
the fireworks show at 7 PM.<pageBreak /><anim id="Eh" target="actor" targetSpec="" /><delay20 />Of course, <delay8 /><anim id="FaintSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />you should do something
much more useful with your time
until then.</message>
	<message label="004" attrib="00 00 00 00"><anim id="FaintSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Looks like the sun is turning in for
the night,<delay20 /><anim id="Cheering" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> which means the main
event is going to begin soon!
<anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I don't know about you, <delay8 /><anim id="Frantic" target="actor" targetSpec="" />but all this
anticipation has my heart racing!</message>
	<message label="005" attrib="00 00 00 00"><anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I think the fireworks show is about to
begin!<delay20 /><anim id="AbsentMindedness" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> This is going to be an evening

	<message label="007" attrib="00 00 00 00"><anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I must admit, <delay20 />I'm intrigued by what's
happening at that stall over there<tag a="110" b="0" /><pageBreak /><anim id="ShyBoy" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I suppose drawing a raffle ticket
wouldn't be such a bad idea.</message>
	<message label="008" attrib="00 00 00 00"><anim id="Hesitate" target="actor" targetSpec="" />You haven't mentioned it, <delay8 />so I guess
I'll just ask<tag a="110" b="0" /><delay20 /> <anim id="ShyBoy" target="actor" targetSpec="" />What do you think of
my <colour id="1" /><tag a="50" b="0" arg="0x100 0xcd03" />star bopper<colour id="65535" />? <delay20 />Does it suit me?
<anim id="Hesitate" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I like to dress up a bit on special
occasions such as these, <delay8 />but I have
been known to get carried away.
<anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />But I've also been known to get
carried away with the idea that I'm
getting carried away!</message>

<anim id="FaintSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It would make it that much more
special to know we're sharing this

you come up with anything good.

available to any visitor needing my
assistance, <delay8 /><anim id="Restless" target="actor" targetSpec="" />so I'm a bit distracted.
<anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />But if that situation changes, I'll be
free to accept possible fireworks
ideas.<delay20 /><anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> I'd love to see yours!
<anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />All you have to do is bring me your
idea in the form of a custom design,<delay8 />
<anim id="Hello" target="actor" targetSpec="" />and I can take it from there.</message>
	<message label="043" attrib="00 00 00 00"><anim id="HappyFlower" target="actor" targetSpec="" />That's what I was hoping you'd say!<delay20 />

take a look at your latest design.</message>
	<message label="045_01" attrib="00 00 00 00"><anim id="Eh" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Nothing to show me, after all?<delay40 /> Well,
if you change your mind, <anim id="FaintSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />you know
where to find me.</message>
	<message label="045_02" attrib="00 00 00 00"><anim id="Eh" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Oh, <delay20 /><anim id="Serious" target="actor" targetSpec="" />so you don't want to add any
custom-design fireworks to the
show, then? <delay20 /><anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />That's too bad.
<anim id="FaintSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />You can always let me know if you
change your mind.</message>
	<message label="045_03" attrib="00 00 00 00"><anim id="Worried" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I'm sorry, <delay8 />but the fireworks show is
over, so I can't accept any more

we have a fireworks show!</message>

to see what you've come up with.<pageBreak /><anim id="Hesitate" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Unfortunately, at the moment I need
to stay available for any visitors
who may require my assistance.
<anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />When that's no longer the case,<delay8 />
<anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I'll start accepting fireworks again.<delay20 />
<anim id="FaintSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Be sure to come back then, OK?</message>
	<message label="013" attrib="00 00 00 00"><anim id="HappyFlower" target="actor" targetSpec="" />The fireworks show has begun! <delay20 />I'm

before midnight, <delay8 />since that's when
the fireworks end!</message>

your <colour id="1" /><tag a="125" b="6" arg="0xcd00" /><colour id="65535" />.
<anim id="Grin" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Another added benefit is that it'll
make you easy to spot! <delay20 /><anim id="Serious" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It can get
pretty dark out here at night.</message>

catch your eye?<pageBreak /><anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Sometimes we choreograph the
fireworks so the custom designs
appear in a set order together.
<anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Keep your eyes on the sky if you

	<message label="048" attrib="00 00 00 00"><anim id="FaintSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I spend most of my time inside
Resident Services, but I love when I

part of this job!</message>
	<message label="034" attrib="00 00 00 00"><anim id="Hesitate" target="actor" targetSpec="" />So, <delay8 />the bad news is that was the last
fireworks show of the year.<pageBreak /><anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />The good news? <delay8 /><anim id="Clapping" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Now we can look
forward to next year's offerings!</message>
	<message label="035" attrib="00 00 00 00"><anim id="FaintSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I think it's appropriate that the last
fireworks show also marks the start
of a new season.
<anim id="AbsentMindedness" target="actor" targetSpec="" />The best part about endings is that
they open up all kinds of possibilities
for new beginnings.</message>
	<message label="036" attrib="00 00 00 00"><anim id="FaintSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Well, at least that last fireworks show
was a true success.<pageBreak /><anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Tomorrow everything'll be back to

working Resident Services again.
But now I'm feeling <anim id="Greeting" target="actor" targetSpec="" />extra inspired
to give it my all!</message>

It's a shame<tag a="110" b="0" /><delay20 /><anim id="Love" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I really love wearing it.</message>
