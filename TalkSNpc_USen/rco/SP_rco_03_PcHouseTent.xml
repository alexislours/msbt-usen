<anim id="IdeaBulb" target="actor" targetSpec="" />And if you want to earn some Bells,
he has a rather generous policy of

<anim id="BigSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />So, go on—craft a net or fishing rod

quickly, a little <colour id="1" />weeding <colour id="65535" />never hurt.
<anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Weeding makes our island prettier,
earns you miles, and you can even
sell the weeds when you're done.

<anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Oh, I suppose "workshop" is
overselling it a bit, hm?
<anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />When you see how simple it is to DIY,
or "do it yourself," you'll understand
what I mean.
<anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />The basic idea is to gather <colour id="1" />materials<colour id="65535" />,
follow a <colour id="1" />recipe<colour id="65535" />, and then craft using
a <colour id="1" />workbench<colour id="65535" /> like this one!</message>
	<message label="206" attrib="00 00 00 00"><anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />So, today we'll be constructing a
<colour id="1" />fishing rod <colour id="65535" />using common materials
that you can find anywhere, yes?
<anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />For this particular recipe, we require
a mere <colour id="1" />5 <tag a="50" b="0" arg="0x100 0xcd03" />tree branches<colour id="65535" />.<delay frames="40" />
<anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" /><size value="75" />It is, admittedly, a little flimsy<tag a="110" b="0" /><size value="100" />

	<message label="207" attrib="00 00 00 00"><anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Ah!<delay20 /> So you have all of the necessary
