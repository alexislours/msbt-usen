	<message label="101">Thanks for the card and the
awesome gift! I can't believe you
went to all that trouble just for me.
I figured I'd return the favor since
you were so thoughtful. Enjoy!</message>
	<message label="102">Wow! You sent me an awesome
letter with an even awesomer gift!
Reading your words lit a fire in my
heart. If I pump iron with the kind
of passion you put into writing, I
bet I'll see some amazing results!</message>
	<message label="103">That was one impressive card you
sent me the other day. Thanks so
much! I was so happy that I just
had to write back right away. But I
didn't know what to write, so take
this gift!</message>
	<message label="104">I got your letter! That was a lot of
words! Reading it felt kind of like
running a marathon, but I'm really
more of a sprinter, so I felt quite a
sense of accomplishment when I
crossed the letter's finish line.</message>
