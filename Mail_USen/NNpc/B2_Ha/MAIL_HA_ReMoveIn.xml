	<message label="006">Yo! <tag a="50" b="3" /><tag a="110" b="3" />!</message>
	<message label="101">Thank you so much for the nice
letter and the welcome gift! You're
the biggest and buffest surprise of
this island so far. I got you a little
something in return.</message>
	<message label="102">Thanks for the welcome gift! It
takes a lot to surprise me, but you
managed to do it. It makes me
think you might be a good sports
competitor for me. Here's a gift
in return.</message>
	<message label="103">Gift giving is kind of like a tennis
match. You served up an ace with
your welcome gift. But wait—it's a
miraculous recovery! I've smashed
your masterful serve! Here comes a
return gift!</message>
	<message label="104">Thanks for sending a card to an
island rookie who's just getting
started. You're like a legendary
coach who inspires the new player
to win the gold medal. That's how
I want to live my life!</message>
	<message label="105">Despite appearances, I'm actually
pretty shy, so your letter really
gave me confidence. I have a few
top-secret training techniques, so
maybe I can teach you the ways of
a pro athlete sometime.</message>
	<message label="106">You sent me a nice letter soon
after I got here, and it really meant
a lot to me. In fact, I'd be willing to
make you my permanent workout
buddy if you think you can handle
sweating that much.</message>
