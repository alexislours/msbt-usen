	<message label="101">I was stoked to get your present!
It's the time of year when stuff like
this is a big help. I can't compete
with your gift, but here's something
in return. Hope you enjoy it.</message>
	<message label="102">Thanks so much for your present!
Reading your letter made me
realize it was a buff year for me.
Here's a little something in return.
I hope you have a great year!</message>
	<message label="103">Thanks for your present! Thanks to
you, I had a fun year. I'm including
a gift in return. It's something I
used during a combined workout
and cleaning session. It's all yours!</message>
	<message label="104">Your card made me look back on
this year with profound feelings.
With this fresh in mind, I'm going to
break through my buffness meter
for real next year! Keep watching!</message>
	<message label="105">The end of the year is such a busy
time. I finished my workout, and
then I read your card and had a
protein shake at the same time!
And then I even thought about
cleaning my house! So busy!</message>
	<message label="106">Thanks for the year-end greetings!
If I relax and lounge around, I might
lose all the muscle I put on this
year, and that would be a huge
waste. I need to make pumping
iron my top priority every year!</message>
