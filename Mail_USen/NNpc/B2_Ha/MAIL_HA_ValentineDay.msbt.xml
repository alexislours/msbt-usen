	<message label="101">It's Valentine's Day! That's when
you challenge your best rival to
feats of strength...or was it give
friends chocolate? Eh, let's do
both and call it a day. Here's some
choco—you work out the rest.</message>
	<message label="102">Happy Valentine's Day! I hear this
is when you challenge your dearest
rival to eat handmade chocolate.
I don't entirely get it, but hey,
it's tradition. Here's some choco
I made with my hands!</message>
	<message label="103">These chocolates were melted by
my fiery moves and cut by my
rock-hard abs. They're probably
still OK to eat, so have at it.
Only the best for my favorite
spotter on Valentine's Day!</message>
	<message label="104">Today's special! It's not leg day.
Not back day. Not even Flex Friday.
It's Valentine's Day! Happy that!
These chocolates taste like glory
and smell like a new personal best,
so I know you'll love 'em.</message>
	<message label="105">Happy Valentine's Day! Heh, bet ya
didn't see this well-toned letter
coming. You're always there to
gaze in awe when I'm flexing, so
consider this gift my thanks. If it
smells like sweat...you're welcome.</message>
	<message label="106">It's Valentine's Day! It's go time!
Take these chocolates, bump my
fist, slam yourself right smack-dab
into my iron wall of a chest, and...
Actually, that should do it. Isn't
Valentine's Day the best?</message>
	<message label="107">I always get some treats from my
protein protégé on Valentine's Day,
and I wanted to share. OK...she
prefers I call her Mom, but that's
beside the point. Enjoy!</message>
	<message label="108">Happy Valentine's Day! Ever since
we met, my workouts have been at
least 20 percent more efficient.
That's why I'm sending you some
"Thanks for the gains" chocolates,
as per local tradition. Eat up!</message>
	<message label="109">It's Valentine's Day, so I lifted a
bunch of weights and then took a
power nap. Oh, and I got you this
gift. If it smells like dumbbells...
I don't know anything about that.</message>
