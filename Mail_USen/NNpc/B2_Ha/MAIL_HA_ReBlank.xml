	<message label="101">The card you sent me the other
day looked like a blank piece of
paper. Even with my super-strong
vision, I didn't see anything. It
made me realize that your super
vision's way better than mine!</message>
	<message label="102">You know you sent me a blank card,
right? It's all good. Sometimes
after a hard workout, I forget
things too. ESPECIALLY word
things. Good hustle getting it in
the mail though!</message>
	<message label="103">I kind of panicked when I got a
blank card from you. Was it a
special message that only the
strong of heart can see? Maybe
I'm not as strong as I think I am?!</message>
