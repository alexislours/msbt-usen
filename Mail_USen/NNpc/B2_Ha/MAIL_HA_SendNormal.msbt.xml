	<message label="101">Sometimes writing letters is nice
because you can write things that
you might not say out loud in
person. Then again, I say almost
everything out loud.</message>
	<message label="102">Check it out! The other day I ran a
triathlon and won a gold medal!
But when I stepped up to the award
podium, I tripped! And then I woke
up. Turns out I was only dreaming.</message>
	<message label="103">I thought of a simple way to train
my fingers. By writing letters, I can
correspond with you while giving
my digits a workout at the same
time. My hands are going to be
incredibly muscular!</message>
	<message label="104">There's one thing I'd like to tell
you today, OK? Muscles aren't
built in a day! Intense daily training
is everything! Don't be a slacker!
OK, that's it.</message>
	<message label="105">I've decided to share my morning
warm-up routine with you. It's three
sets of <tag a="90" b="2" arg="0x100" /> sit-ups, three sets of
<tag a="90" b="2" arg="0x101" /> push-ups, and three sets of
<tag a="90" b="2" arg="0x102" /> squats. I usually do way more
than that, but it's a good baseline.</message>
	<message label="106">I'm stuck on a workout plateau, so I
decided to try something different:
writing letters. It's the ultimate
type of muscle-confusion program.
My hands have never been so buff,
and it's all thanks to you!</message>
	<message label="107">You're always doing so much for
me, so I wrote this letter to tell you
how much I appreciate you,
<tag a="110" b="3" />. You challenge
me, and I look forward to
continuing our rivalry.</message>
	<message label="108">My muscles have been especially
sore lately. But that's a sign that
I'm getting stronger, right? I can't
wait to see how much they've
grown once this soreness is gone.</message>
	<message label="109">I thought of an idea where you
have a special day to write a good
friend a letter. I call it, "Write a
Good Friend a Letter Day." I'm so
glad I have you to write to!</message>
	<message label="110">Sometimes I hear others talking
about training their brains. But I
have no idea how to lift to work my
brain muscles. I'm kinda worried
I'm gonna fall behind. Help!</message>
