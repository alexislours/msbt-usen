	<message label="101">Our competition got pretty intense
the other day, didn't it? I'm
sending a little prize I wasn't able
to pass along to you at the time.
I hope we can play again one of
these days!</message>
	<message label="102">I got so excited playing that game
with you the other day, I think
I'm STILL sweating from it! Also,
I've sent you the fruit I owe you.
We should play again sometime!</message>
	<message label="103">I really enjoyed our game the other
day. Please take this because, as
they say, "to Victor go the spoils."
(Which I think is true whether or
not your name is Victor.) Anyway,
let's play again one of these days.</message>
