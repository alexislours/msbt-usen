	<message label="101">Did you really add a new room to
your place? That's awesome!
You ARE gonna turn it into a gym,
right? RIGHT?! 'Cause I want a
membership. Here's something to
cover my membership dues.</message>
	<message label="102">Your place got bigger? Yeah, I'm
not too buff to admit I'm a little
jealous. Well, here's something I no
longer have room for because of
my titanic arms. Maybe you can
find a spot for it!</message>
	<message label="103">What kinda workout routine is your
house doing? Are you pouring
protein shakes on the siding?
Because I can't believe how swole
your place is getting! Here's a little
house warm-up gift!</message>
	<message label="104">Two floors?! That's mind-blowing!
You have GOT to get a hot tub and
a sauna in your place. Can you
think of anything better than a day
at the spa after a workout? 'Cause
I can't! Oh, I got you something!</message>
