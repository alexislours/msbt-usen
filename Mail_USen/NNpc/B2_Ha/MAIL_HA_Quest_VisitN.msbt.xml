other day. I'm sending you a gift
I wasn't able to give you then.
I hope you enjoy it. And feel free
to stop by for a workout sometime.
My gym is always open!</message>
	<message label="102">It was so cool when you came by to
visit me the other day. I'm so sorry
that I didn't make you a protein
shake! Oh well. Maybe next time.</message>
	<message label="103">It was so fun when you came over
the other day. You know, sometimes
I think I should just turn my home
into a gym and recruit some
workouters. Worker outers?
Workoutees? I really like friends.</message>
	<message label="104">The other day was so much fun that
I did <tag a="90" b="3" arg="0x100" /> chin-ups to burn off the
extra energy. Oh, here's the thing
you left behind. I was gonna bring
it over myself, but the chin-ups
kinda turned my arms into noodles.</message>
