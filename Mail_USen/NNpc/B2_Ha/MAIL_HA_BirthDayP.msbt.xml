	<message label="101">What's up, birthday bud? So, I was
doing sprints over by the airport,
and suddenly I remembered I still
needed to send you that birthday
gift from before! Hope it's not TOO
heavy for you. Enjoy!</message>
	<message label="102">What's up? Getting that birthday
bod in buff shape? Here's that gift
I couldn't give you before. I
wrapped it in extra-tough paper
'cause I know how you like to flex
those bonkers-tier biceps!</message>
	<message label="103">Happy birthday! I'm sending along
the present I couldn't give you
before. Also, sorry about the sweat
stains on the card. I accidentally
grabbed this letter instead of my
towel after cardio yesterday...</message>
	<message label="104">Remember those cupcakes from
your birthday bash? Surprise! Well,
probably not too surprising.
Whatever, here you go. Don't scarf
'em all at once, alright? Let's
smash our quads later!</message>
	<message label="105">Here are those birthday cupcakes I
said I was gonna send. My writing
muscles are kind of cramping up
right now and I don't know what
else to say, so now I'm just filling
up space. My fingers hurt.</message>
	<message label="106">Here are the cupcakes from your
big day! I almost mistook the box
for a crate full of random free
weights I've been training with this
week. It felt kinda light. Enjoy your
cupcakes!</message>
	<message label="107">Thanks for the cupcake the other
day! I've sent you a birthday gift
that I wasn't able to pass along the
other day. It comes with my wish
that you get super-mega-buff in
the coming year.</message>
	<message label="108">Here's the birthday gift I wasn't
able to hand you the other day.
Also thanks for the birthday
cupcake. The sugar rush I got from
it really boosted my next workout.
You're a good bud. Keep in touch!</message>
	<message label="109">Sorry I'm late, but I'm sending you
a birthday present. I swear I didn't
just get something for you at the
last minute because you shared a
cupcake with me. The timing just
worked out that way! Yeah...</message>
