	<message label="101">The best coaches are the ones
who can call quick, short plays.
Your quick, short message meant
the world to me. See you in the
arena, bud!</message>
	<message label="102">Even though your message was
short, your feelings really came
across. Also, it was super short, so
I was able to read it all the way to
the end!</message>
	<message label="103">Are short letters all the rage now?
Cool! I accept the challenge! Here
goes! Oh man. I've already written
way too much. You're way better at
this than I am.</message>
	<message label="104">The card you sent proves the old
saying, "Simpler is better." You put
your thoughts into words, and I'm
impressed. Although, you could
write a bit more next time, if you
want to.</message>
	<message label="105">Hey! Friends don't let friends slack
off when it comes to letter writing!
You're not getting a very good
finger workout when you write so
few words. Put your heart muscle
into it next time!</message>
	<message label="106">Your letter was so short, it made
me wonder if there was some sort
of encrypted, hidden message
there. I looked for hours, but I
couldn't crack your code.</message>
