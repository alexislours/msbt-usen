	<message label="101">I can't believe you sent me so many
letters! You must've gone on a
writing frenzy! I could practically
smell the sweat on the cards. You
deserve this present from me for
all your writing efforts.</message>
	<message label="102">I finally finished reading the cards
you sent. It's been a while since
I've seen so many words, and I
started to get dizzy! I figured if I
send you a gift, maybe you'll take it
easy on me next time.</message>
	<message label="103">Your card offensive really did
the trick and hit me like a sucker
punch! But I won't go down
without a fight! I'm going to
counter with an all-out card
offensive of my own!</message>
	<message label="104">I was surprised that you had so
much to say in your card. Maybe
next time it'll be better if we just
chat face-to-face. We can get a jog
in too! If you ever want to talk, or
jog, or both, I'll always make time!</message>
	<message label="105">I was totally unprepared for the
volley of cards you sent my way.
I assume this is some sort of
challenge? If so, bring it on! I can
handle all the letters you can send!</message>
	<message label="106">Your card offensive nearly broke
open my mailbox! It's not very
sportsmanlike to counter a move
like that with an identical move, so
I'm only striking back with this
one letter. Take that!</message>
