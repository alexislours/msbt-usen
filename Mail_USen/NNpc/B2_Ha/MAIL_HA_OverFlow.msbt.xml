	<message label="101">If there's one thing I know nothing
about, it's having a limit to how
much I can lift. It sounds kinda fun!
What's it like? The way you left
that thing behind was like...whoa!
Oh, and by the way, here it is.</message>
	<message label="102">Usually I only send packages so
the mail folks can have ultra-heavy
stuff to lift. But this time I sent that
thing you couldn't take with you
the other day, which is only KINDA
heavy. I hope they still liked it.</message>
	<message label="103">It was fun hanging out with you the
other day. Oh! Remember the thing
I couldn't give you 'cause your
pockets were full? Here it is. Also, I
might've done <tag a="90" b="3" arg="0x100" /> biceps curls
with it, so I hope it wasn't fragile!</message>
