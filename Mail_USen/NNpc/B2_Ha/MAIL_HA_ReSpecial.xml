	<message label="101">I tried on the clothing you gave me.
It fits my body and shows off the
contours of my muscles, so of
course I love it! I figured you
deserve something in return, so
take this gift.</message>
	<message label="102">I tried on the clothing you sent me
the other day, and it fits perfectly.
You're the best! So I thought I'd
return the favor, with great big
biceps of gratitude.</message>
	<message label="103">I'm using the clothing you sent me
as training gear! More and more of
my sweat soaks into it every day,
so it should be worn-in soon. I'll
have to let you check it out one of
these days!</message>
	<message label="104">Believe it or not, I'm not the best
at something...interior decorating.
Where would be the coolest place
to put the furniture you gave me?
I could use some advice. But for
now, here's a gift for you!</message>
	<message label="105">Thanks for the gift you gave me!
I'm not sure if you meant for this to
happen, but it's coming in handy
during my workouts. Almost
anything can be used for strength
training if you lift it enough!</message>
	<message label="106">I got your present! So cool! Please
accept this thank-you gift in
return. It's a special present with
my heart and soul poured into it.
And some sweat too, I guess.</message>
	<message label="107">Thanks for the present! I was a bit
surprised because I already own
the exact same thing. But maybe I
can turn the pair into dumbbells.
Anyway, this just proves that we're
on the same wavelength.</message>
	<message label="108">Thanks for your gift the other day!
Getting a gift from a fan like that
puts me in the ranks of elite
athletes. Which I guess it puts you
in the ranks of elite superfans.</message>
	<message label="109">So I was headed out to plant your
gift when I kinda...dropped it
behind my couch. Wow! I really,
REALLY need to clean back there
more often. COINCIDENTALLY, this
was behind my couch. Enjoy!</message>
	<message label="110">Oh this is for that training trick,
right? If you practice jumping over
a sapling every day, your jumping
ability will improve, yeah? If that's
true, I'll be a super jumper soon!</message>
	<message label="111">You sent money with your letter!
Is that pocket money for me? Are
you worried about my money
situation? My money muscles do
need more conditioning though.
Time to pump up my wallet!</message>
	<message label="112">Thank you for the cool music
present! I've been doing <tag a="90" b="2" arg="0x100" /> reps
of exercises for my abs and back
muscles every day to the beat.
I can't wait to see how I look in
a month!</message>
	<message label="113">I'm using the gift you gave me
every day. A practical present like
that really comes in handy,
especially since I normally try to
do everything with my bare hands.</message>
	<message label="114">I've been using that art you sent
to try to bulk up my mind through
meditation, but I don't think it's
working. All I've been able to do
with my mind so far is bend a
spoon! Guess I'll keep trying.</message>
	<message label="118">I got your fossil! Are you sure it's
OK for me to have it? It's like the
discovery of the century! Let me
just say that your kind deed has
been forever engraved in this
tough guy's heart muscle.</message>
	<message label="119">A fossil that hasn't been appraised
is full of mystery, isn't it? I bet if I
work out while thinking about what
it is, I'd get so strong that even
the fiercest dinosaur wouldn't want
a piece of me! Yeah!</message>
	<message label="120">Thanks for the present! I was
so shocked to get something I
already had. In return, I'm sending
you something that I hope will
shock you in return!</message>
	<message label="121">Thanks for the present! I love
surprises, but I didn't realize that
a surprise could make me so
happy! My grin muscles are getting
a serious workout! You deserve
something in return. Enjoy!</message>
