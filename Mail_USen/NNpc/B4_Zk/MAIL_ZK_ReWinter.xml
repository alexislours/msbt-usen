	<message label="006">Dearest <tag a="110" b="3" />,</message>
	<message label="101">Look at you, taking time out of
your busy holiday schedule to
send me such a thoughtful gift
and card. Well, I hope you find
my reply equally thoughtful, and
my gift equally generous!</message>
	<message label="102">It would have been enough for you
to simply send a nice letter. But
you went above and beyond with
such a thoughtful gift too! Well, I
can't let myself be outdone like
that, so I hope you enjoy this!</message>
	<message label="103">I was just thinking about you when
your card and present arrived.
What a nice surprise! Were you
using telepathy, or what? If so,
please teach me! Wait...what
am I thinking about...right NOW?</message>
	<message label="104">Reading your note confirmed what
I always assumed to be true—I have
amazing taste in friends. If you
ever doubt how great you are, just
remember that you've met my
incredibly high standards.</message>
	<message label="105">Hey, I just wanted to write back in
appreciation for the note you sent
me. I know it's busy at this time of
year, so that's why it means that
much more to send something
personal like that. Thank you!</message>
	<message label="106">My holiday spirit went through
the roof when I got your letter.
I started thinking back to all the
good times we've had... It's been
something else, hasn't it? Well,
here's hoping for another fab year!</message>
