	<message label="101">Here's that present I tried to give
you earlier. I wanted to make sure
you got it before it goes out of
style. Sometimes staying ahead of
the trend feels like a full-time job!
Anyway...enjoy!</message>
	<message label="102">I picked this out just for you. Last
time I tried to give it to you things
didn't go to plan, so I've resorted
to using good old-fashioned snail
mail. I know—so retro! Now stop
reading and open it already.</message>
	<message label="103">Remember that thank-you gift I
got for you? Well, I decided to do
the classy thing and have it
delivered right to your door.
I'm just THAT grateful.</message>
