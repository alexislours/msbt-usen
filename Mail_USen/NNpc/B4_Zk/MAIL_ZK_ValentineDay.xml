	<message label="003">To my Valentine's VIP <tag a="110" b="3" />,</message>
	<message label="004">Sweet <tag a="110" b="3" />,</message>
	<message label="005">Fun fact, <tag a="110" b="3" />...</message>

	<message label="009">Hey, <tag a="110" b="3" />...</message>
	<message label="101">No matter how much time we spend
together, I can never get enough.
You're like my favorite TV show, in
human form! Anyway, I got you a
little gift. Can't wait for the next
episode. Ha HA!</message>
	<message label="102">Your smile makes me as happy as
the most expensive fragrance that
I own. Speaking of fragrances,
I hope this little gift tickles your
nose's fancy! Happy Valentine's
Day, <tag a="110" b="5" />!</message>
	<message label="103">I know, I know... Giving someone a
bunch of red roses feels serious,
but that's because it IS! I take our
friendship as seriously as an
audition, so you know you can
count on me to overdo it. Ha HA!</message>
	<message label="104">Is that a weird way to start the
letter? Sorry, it's just that it's
Valentine's Day and you're always
sweet to me. Also, I was just eating
<tag a="135" b="7" arg="0xcd00" />, so it was on my
mind. Happy Valentine's Day!</message>
	<message label="105">Every time I think of you, a rose
blooms in my heart. OK, maybe it's
not a "fact," but it's fun, right?
Anyway, I figured I'd get you some
roses for Valentine's Day since you
always make me smile.</message>
	<message label="106">Happy Valentine's Day! I made a
flower bouquet that represents all
the great memories we've made
together. Let's make more of them,
and maybe <tag a="50" b="2" /><tag a="135" b="4" arg="0xcd00" /> album
while we're at it!</message>
	<message label="107">Happy Valentine's Day! You know
how they say that you should stop
and smell the roses? Well, I gotchu.
You can smell these babies all day,
<tag a="110" b="5" />! I hope it's a happy
one for you.</message>
	<message label="108">You're always so nice to me, so I
just had to write and say, "Happy
Valentine's Day!" I hope you heard
it in my voice—that means the
branding is working. Ha HA!
Anyway, you're the best.</message>
	<message label="109">You know what today is, right?
It's Valentine's Day! At least, it
was when I wrote this. I want you
to smile right...NOW! And know
that I'm probably smiling too,
wherever I am. Probably shopping.</message>
