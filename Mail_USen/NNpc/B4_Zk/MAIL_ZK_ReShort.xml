	<message label="101">That card you sent me, composed
so tightly with so few words...it
was almost like poetry. Scratch
thatâ€”it WAS poetry. I'll be reading
it at an upcoming slam! Here's a
little thank-you for the material.</message>
	<message label="102">It's so YOU to send such a
minimalist note with a maximalist
gift. Trust me, even though you
didn't say a lot, I got the message,
and I got you something in return.
Oops! I've already said too much.</message>
	<message label="103">Sending a short card with a cool
gift is such a power move. It's like
you're a busy network executive
who really cares about his friends,
but has no time for them. That's
literally my favorite type of person.</message>
	<message label="104">Your letter may have been on the
short side, but it was packed with
authentic feelings. That's the kind
of thing that just can't be faked,
no matter how hard I try.</message>
	<message label="105">Thank you for the letter. At first
I was a little hung up on how short
it was, but then I realized that you
simply expressed your feelings in
a super efficient way. It inspired
me to try and do the same!</message>
	<message label="106">It took me a while to understand
the point of that short note you
sent me, but then I got it. It's
about what you DIDN'T write, like
the blank space in a painting,
right? Or do I still not get it...</message>
