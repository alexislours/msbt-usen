	<message label="101">Thanks for being so nice to me,
especially since I'm new to the
island. You even sent a welcome
gift! Who does that anymore? I'll
tell you who—really cool folks who
are going to be my friends!</message>
	<message label="102">Just writing to say thanks for
sending me that letter and gift.
It's really cool of you to welcome
me to your island like that! I got
you a little something to show off
my <tag a="110" b="10" /> style!</message>
	<message label="103">Hey, thanks for sending the gift
and card. It really means a lot to
a rookie like me. I already feel like
I belong now, you know? Would you
accept a small gift in return? Too
late—you already did!</message>
	<message label="104">Getting a note from you so soon
after I moved in was really sweet.
Thanks to you, I feel like I already
belong here! I hope I can count
on you to listen to my long, weird
stories attentively.</message>
	<message label="105">I hate to admit it, but I was pretty
nervous about moving here. Then
I got that letter from you! That's
such a cool thing to do for a
newcomer like me. Anyway, good to
meet you, and let's hang out soon!</message>
	<message label="106">That card you sent me was really
thoughtful! I guess you must know
what it's like to be a newbie,
because you made me feel right
at home. Now I'm sure I made the
right choice in moving here.</message>
