	<message label="101">They say that there's a hat for
every head, and I think I've found
the one for you. I bought it the
instant I saw it, and I knew that I'd
be sending it to you. Can't wait to
see you try it on!</message>
	<message label="102">You know that my style is always
on point, from head to toe. And
sometimes when I see something
that would look good on someone
else, I get it for them. Well, today's
your lucky day!</message>
	<message label="103">I had a weird dream about you last
night, and I wanted to give you
this. But now that I'm writing this
letter, I realize it doesn't make
sense. Well, here's an umbrella.
(It made sense in the dream.)</message>
	<message label="104">It's your lucky day! I was doing a
little shopping when I came across
this spicy number. Not everyone
can pull it off, but I think you've
got the sense of style to give it
a proper home. Enjoy!</message>
	<message label="105">OK, so bear with me here... I was
thinking about how cool you'd look
in something classic, so I actually
went and picked this up for you!
Is that weird? Probably a little, but
it's to your benefit. Enjoy!</message>
	<message label="106">I had the most amazing dream the
other night. You and I co-owned a
very hip housewares boutique
and business was booming. This
was our bestselling item. Should we
make this dream a reality?</message>
	<message label="107">I saw this wallpaper and one word
came to mind: "<tag a="110" b="3" />."
It was then followed by "exquisite,"
"high-class," and "trendsetting."
The point is, this is more than just
wallpaper. It's a lifestyle.</message>
	<message label="108">Last night I was just about to fall
into a deep and dreamless slumber
when it hit me—your floors are all
wrong. I was up all night trying to
pick out the perfect replacement.
Did I succeed? Yes. Yes, I did.</message>
	<message label="109">I bet you've never seen art like this
before! Neither have I, which is
why I bought it for you. I'm dying
to know what you think about it,
how it makes you feel, how much
you love it, etc.</message>
	<message label="110">A great <tag a="110" b="15" /> once said,
"There is nothing more luxurious
than a rug." I believe the contents
of this package will prove that to
be true. I'd keep it for myself, but
impeccable taste is worth sharing.</message>
