	<message label="101">They say that there's a hat for
every head, and I think I've found
the one for you. I bought it the
instant I saw it, and I knew that I'd
be sending it to you. Can't wait to
see you try it on!</message>
	<message label="102">You know that my style is always
on point, from head to toe. And
sometimes when I see something
that would look good on someone
else, I get it for them. Well, today's
your lucky day!</message>
	<message label="103">I had a weird dream about you last
night, and I wanted to give you
this. But now that I'm writing this
letter, I realize it doesn't make
sense. Well, here's an umbrella.
(It made sense in the dream.)</message>
	<message label="104">It's your lucky day! I was doing a
little shopping when I came across
this spicy number. Not everyone
can pull it off, but I think you've
got the sense of style to give it
a proper home. Enjoy!</message>
	<message label="105">OK, so bear with me here... I was
thinking about how cool you'd look
in something classic, so I actually
went and picked this up for you!
Is that weird? Probably a little, but
it's to your benefit. Enjoy!</message>
