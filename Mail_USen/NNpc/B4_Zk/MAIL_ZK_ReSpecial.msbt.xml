	<message label="101">Those clothes you sent me? You
can't see this, but I'm making a
chef's kiss gesture right now. So
good! Well, I can't be outdone, so
I picked out an outfit for you too.</message>
	<message label="102">Yo, thank you for that designer
gift! I can't believe you went and
picked it out just for me. Well, I
can't let that favor go unreturned,
can I? Here's a chic little number
for you, amigo.</message>
	<message label="103">I just got your present and I can
already imagine what's inside...
A TV-ready outfit for when I make
my small-screen debut, right?
Ha HA! I'm just kidding, but this is
no joke—I got you something too.</message>
	<message label="104">Hey, thanks a ton for the gift.
I can't look at it without thinking of
you. That was the idea, right? Well,
allow me to return the favor! Think
fondly of <tag a="110" b="10" /> when
you look upon this beauty.</message>
	<message label="105">Hey, just writing to say thanks for
the furniture. I usually pick my own
stuff out, and it's pretty avant-
garde, but not always the most
comfy. In return, here's something
a little artsy for your collection!</message>
	<message label="106">Yo, that furniture you got me really
blew my mind! It's not something
I would have picked out myself,
but now I can't live without it.
You've gotta let me pay you back
with this hand-selected piece.</message>
	<message label="107">Yoooo! Great minds think alike,
am I right? I am, because you
sent me a piece of furniture that
I already own. No worries though.
I'll just live large with two of them.
Ha HA! Oh yeah! This is for you.</message>
	<message label="108">Hey, I had to write to say thanks
for that particularly aromatic gift.
I...was supposed to eat it, right?
I've made that mistake before,
believe me. Anyway, here's a small
gift for you. Don't eat it!</message>
	<message label="109">I got the lovely gift you sent,
compadre. Don't worry. I'll plant
those flowers and water them
with hairspray. Extra firm hold
for strong roots, right? Oh! I got
you something too. Enjoy!</message>
	<message label="110">Whoa. I'm seriously blown away
by the sapling you gave me. That's
a gift that really says something,
you know? Well, I'm putting down
some roots by giving you THIS!
Hope you like it, friend.</message>
	<message label="111">Whoa, whoa, whoa! What's the
big idea sending me Bells? What
are you trying to say? I mean, I
appreciate the thought, but next
time, just send a tasteful yet
expensive gift. Like this! Ha HA!</message>
	<message label="112">That music you sent me was sick!
I've never heard anything like it.
Was that...a lack of thumping bass
I detected? What a concept! Well,
I got something for you too. I hope
it's just as life changing for you.</message>
	<message label="113">That gift you sent me was really...
practical. And I don't mean that
in a bad way. Like, you actually
sent me something that you figured
I could use. It's revolutionary! So,
I got you this. Hope you can use it!</message>
	<message label="114">The moment I laid eyes on the work
of art that you gave me, I was
struck to the deepest reaches of
my heart by its beauty. Who saw
that coming? I hope this thank-you
gift hits you just as hard.</message>
	<message label="118">Aww, you knew I liked vintage stuff,
so you got me an actual fossil.
That's so literal of you! Anyway,
this made a meteor-like impact
on my soul, so I tried to pick out
something good for you too.</message>
	<message label="119">I don't know what I expected, but
it definitely wasn't this. And that's
super cool! Nothing like a mystery
package with a mystery gift inside
to get my heart thumping. Now I'll
return the favor. Guess what it is!</message>
	<message label="120">Greetings, my good-taste twin!
I was surprised—but not THAT
surprised—to see that you sent
me something that I already own.
Great minds, eh? Anyway, I got you
something too. Hope you like it!</message>
	<message label="121">Yo! I got your gift, and I could tell
that you really put your heart into
it. So I decided to do the same
for you. I hope you enjoy what I
picked out, but if you don't...it
was just a joke. Ha HA!</message>
