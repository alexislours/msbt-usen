	<message label="101">So...you just sent me a blank card.
Was that on purpose? Was it a
statement of some kind? Are you
trying out a new minimalist style
of writing and I just don't get it?
Please tell me what to think!</message>
	<message label="102">You sure are excitable, aren't you?
You went to all the trouble of
sending me a note...with nothing
written inside! That's like the kind
of thing I'd do. Well, I'm sure you
meant to say SOMETHING...</message>
	<message label="103">I'm still not sure what to make
of the blank letter you sent me.
Were you too shy to write what
you really felt, so you just left it
up to my imagination? Well, if so...
Well done! It worked perfectly.</message>
