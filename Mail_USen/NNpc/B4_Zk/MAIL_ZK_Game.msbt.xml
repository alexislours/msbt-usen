	<message label="101">Alright, this isn't easy to admit,
but you beat me fair and square
in that game. So here are the
fabulous prizes I owe you. Fair
play, and let's do it again soon.
I need to get even!</message>
	<message label="102">Alright, here are the prizes that
you won earlier and couldn't carry
home with you. Eat them, plant
them, do whatever you want—
they're all yours! I hope we can
play again sometime...</message>
	<message label="103">Sure, winning is fun, but it's not
quite the same unless you actually
get to collect your prize! So here
are your winnings from before.
Savor them, because next time we
play, I'm coming out on top!</message>
