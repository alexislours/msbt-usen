	<message label="005">To my biggest fan, <tag a="110" b="3" />,</message>
	<message label="006">To the "mail master,"</message>
	<message label="101">Thank you for all of those letters,
and for all of the feverish feelings
crammed into each of them. Plus
gifts?! You're too much. I can't
possibly make it up to you, but at
least I'll give it a try.</message>
	<message label="102">I finally finished reading all of
those letters you sent me. Wow!
And those gifts... You're really
something else. I tried to pick out
the perfect thank-you gift for you,
so I hope you really like it.</message>
	<message label="103">Wow! You really put all kinds of
feelings out there when you sent
me all those letters. I love it! Not
to mention the lovely gifts... Well, I
can't quite match your generosity,
but hopefully you appreciate this...</message>
	<message label="104">My mailbox was overflowing with
all the fan letters you sent me!
I wish I had time to write a
response to each and every one,
but, well... This one reply is gonna
have to do the trick.</message>
	<message label="105">I gotta say, all of the letters you
wrote me really took my breath
away. It's super sweet of you to
spend so much time thinking of
me, and only a little sad!</message>
	<message label="106">There I was, about to open my
mailbox, expecting maybe one or
two letters. Then...BOOM! You
happened! There were...no words.
I guess you had all of 'em.
Anyway, thanks!</message>
