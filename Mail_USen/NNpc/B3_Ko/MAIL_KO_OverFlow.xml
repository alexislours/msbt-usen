	<message label="101">Thank you for doin' what you did.
The kindness you showed me really
warms the ol' ticker. I toldja that I'd
send you a little somethin' in return
on account of your pockets bein'
full, so here that is, as promised!</message>
	<message label="102">Just wanted to say thanks again!
Along with this note, I'm sendin'
the thank-you gift you didn't have
a free hand to carry home then.
Hope it's somethin' you like, after
I made you wait like this for it...</message>
	<message label="103">Thanks again for what you did for
me! You're alright, you know that?
Ain't used to feelin' warm 'n fuzzy.
I'm sendin' along that gift that you
didn't have a free hand to carry,
and my gratitude along with it.</message>
