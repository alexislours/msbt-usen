	<message label="101">I got this shirt that I really liked,
but it doesn't fit me right anymore.
So I figured I'd send it your way.
The colors are easy on the eyes...
nothin' too crazy. So try it on and
see what ya think.</message>
	<message label="102">I couldn't help but notice you've
been workin' mighty hard lately.
Way I see it, you deserve a proper
thank you. So I sent ya a present!
Try it on...and try to relax a bit.
You deserve it, kiddo!</message>
	<message label="103">I know this is kinda out of the
blue, but I spotted this piece of
furniture the other day and it made
me think of you. So I'm sending it
your way. I think it'd look real
sharp in your place. Hope ya like it!</message>
	<message label="104">They say you should always put yer
best foot forward. So, kiddo, I got
a little somethin' for those dogs of
yours. I think they'll look real sharp
on ya. Sizewise, I took a guess.
But try 'em on. I bet they fit!</message>
	<message label="105">Came across this rarity somewhere,
and figured I'd treat you to a gift
you weren't expectin'! It's well past
time I thanked you for all you do.
I won't hear you say you won't take
this, so lemme know what you think.</message>
