	<message label="101">I got this shirt that I really liked,
but it doesn't fit me right anymore.
So I figured I'd send it your way.
The colors are easy on the eyes...
nothin' too crazy. So try it on and
see what ya think.</message>
	<message label="102">I couldn't help but notice you've
been workin' mighty hard lately.
Way I see it, you deserve a proper
thank you. So I sent ya a present!
Try it on...and try to relax a bit.
You deserve it, kiddo!</message>
	<message label="103">I know this is kinda out of the
blue, but I spotted this piece of
furniture the other day and it made
me think of you. So I'm sending it
your way. I think it'd look real
sharp in your place. Hope ya like it!</message>
	<message label="104">They say you should always put yer
best foot forward. So, kiddo, I got
a little somethin' for those dogs of
yours. I think they'll look real sharp
on ya. Sizewise, I took a guess.
But try 'em on. I bet they fit!</message>
	<message label="105">Came across this rarity somewhere,
and figured I'd treat you to a gift
you weren't expectin'! It's well past
time I thanked you for all you do.
I won't hear you say you won't take
this, so lemme know what you think.</message>
	<message label="106">I'm not too much for interior
decoratin', but exterior decoratin'
is a whole other story. Now, you
take this and gussy up the front of
your house with it, OK?</message>
	<message label="107">Don't get me wrong—rain's got
its place, kiddo. You want it on
your garden and you want it in
your pond. But if you don't want
it on your head, maybe use this.</message>
	<message label="108">I don't even know where this came
from, but I ain't got the space for
it anymore! It's collectin' dust, and
I need that dust for my dust
collection. So, it's yours now.
Do what ya will with it, kiddo.</message>
	<message label="109">I found this little number buried in
my closet and I thought of you. I
can't pull it off anymore, but maybe
you can. Shoot, I know you can!
Wear it and think of me. Gahaha!
Yeah, I spelled out a laugh.</message>
	<message label="110">You've been on my mind lately,
so I thought I'd send ya a little
somethin' to let you know I was
thinkin' about ya. Hope it brings
you a bit of good luck and whatnot.
You deserve it, kiddo!</message>
