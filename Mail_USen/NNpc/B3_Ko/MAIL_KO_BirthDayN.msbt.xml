	<message label="006">Hey, <tag a="110" b="3" />!</message>
	<message label="101">Thanks again for comin' by to help
me celebrate my birthday the other
day. You helped make gettin' older
halfway tolerable. Thanks, kiddo!
Anyway, here's somethin' I got you.
Hope it's the sorta thing you like!</message>
	<message label="102">I gotta thank you again for the gift.
I reckon you do understand the
REAL <tag a="110" b="10" />—not too
many folks can say that. Anyway,
here's a little somethin' in return.
Figured it was the least I could do!</message>
	<message label="103">Wow! That gift you gave me the
other day really rattled me—in a
good way! Right away I knew I had
to rush out to find somethin' you'd
like just as much. Here it is...
Be sure to let me know how I did!</message>
	<message label="104">Sure was nice to spend my big day
with a cool kiddo like you. And you
even got me a gift! I take back any
bad stuff I've ever said about you.
Plus here's the cherry on top—
I got you somethin' too!</message>
	<message label="105">Thanks for everythin' the other
day. I grin like an idiot every time
I look at that gift you got for me.
Heh. Well, I got you somethin' in
return. I hope it gives you lotsa
grins of your own. Enjoy, kiddo!</message>
	<message label="106">I just had to write and say thanks
again for celebratin' my big day
with me. Oh, and...I got you a little
somethin'. I had to send it with this
letter because I might've gotten all
misty handin' it to you in person.</message>
