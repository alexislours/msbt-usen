	<message label="101">You keepin' yourself healthy these
days? You gotta be strong if you
wanna go toe-to-toe with me! And
to get strong, you gotta recover
well. And that means watchin'
plenty of TV and loungin' around.</message>
	<message label="102">Take it from me, kiddo. The more
you use a tool, the more it'll break
in and fit your hands perfectly.
Treat it almost like a plant that'll
grow as you nourish it. Isn't it
satisfyin' to fix things yourself?</message>
	<message label="103">I was gonna write you a whole
thing about how amazing bonsai
trees are, but then I started
daydreamin' about 'em and pretty
soon I realized that I can't really
cover it in a note, so here we are.</message>
	<message label="104">I'm probably always yakkin' about
how you should work hard, but
you gotta know how to kick back
and be lazy too! It's an important
life skill, kiddo. Go take a bath, eat
some candy, and call me tomorrow.</message>
	<message label="105">I was just walkin' around the other
day, thinkin' about nothin' in
particular, when I suddenly thought
of you. Not sure why, but I thought
I'd better send you a quick note in
case you felt like writin' back.</message>
	<message label="106">I've been readin' a lot of fishin'
magazines lately, and lemme tell
you, they're filled with all kinds of
goofy words. Like...wobbling. And
crankbait. I looked 'em up, but it's
not helpin' me get better at fishin'.</message>
	<message label="107">Makin' easy money sounds good,
right? Well, it's never that easy!
Some folks that look like they're
just sailin' through life might be
workin' real hard behind the
scenes. No shortcuts, kiddo!</message>
	<message label="108">News flash, kiddo—the ocean of
life has waves! Now, ridin' down
the face of 'em is pretty sweet.
But paddlin' to the top? Now that's
the tricky part. Learn to do that,
and you'll go far.</message>
	<message label="109">How's life treatin' you these days?
It just seemed like a good time to
write you a note and check in.
I know I might be grumpy from time
to time, but I'm really rootin' hard
for you, kiddo.</message>
	<message label="110">Know what I don't get? Tryin' on
your own clothes in the mirror. You
bought 'em, so you already know
what they look like! Just throw on
whatever and start your day! Yeah,
I'm not exactly a fashion guru.</message>
