	<message label="012">Dear <tag a="110" b="3" />,</message>
	<message label="101">Visitin' your place was the bee's
knees, kiddo. Reckon I learned
a bit about you, but I left even
more curious than when I arrived!
Let's do it again sometime, OK?
For now, here's a thank-you gift.</message>
	<message label="102">Whaddaya got goin' on in that
secret room, anyway? You're the
last one I thought'd be mysterious,
and that's comin' from this weirdo!
So, here's a gift. It's a shameless
bribe to get me into that room...</message>
	<message label="103">I was surprised to see how laid-
back you are about organizin'...
I might seem scattered brainwise,
but I do try to keep things tidy.
Maybe you could use somethin'
like this at home? Hope it helps!</message>
	<message label="104">Just wanted to thank you for
havin' me over and showin' me
some of those newfangled ideas
you had about settin' up furniture.
Really gives me a lot to chew on.
Here's a little gift to say thanks.</message>
	<message label="105">It was real friendly of you to have
me over to visit, but I gotta say
I'm a little confused. You sure you
actually live there? Are you some
kinda sleeper agent? Well, in case
you're not, maybe you can use this.</message>
	<message label="106">You've got a real comfortable
place there, kiddo. It's so comfy,
I think I might just come and visit
a LOT more often. Just kiddin'!
I'm actually just gonna give you
this gift, and steal your style.</message>
	<message label="107">Thanks again for havin' me over,
kiddo. Afterward, I got to thinkin'...
A few of those walls seemed awful
sparse. You really need somethin'
to look at in your home, so I got
you this. Hope you don't mind.</message>
	<message label="108">How in the world did you manage
to collect all that rare stuff, kiddo?
I'm like a million years older, and
I don't have half as much as you.
But did you have one of THESE?
Oh, hang on—reckon you do now...</message>
	<message label="109">Wow! I had no idea what I was in
for when you invited me over,
kiddo. You must be rollin' in Bells!
I'm almost kinda embarrassed to
give you this, but I'd feel worse
givin' you nothin', so here we go.</message>
	<message label="110">Just wanted to say thanks for
lettin' me tour your place. I gotta
ask though... You really go for
that minimal style, huh? Well, in
case you wanna add some more
POP, I got you this little somethin'.</message>
	<message label="111">It was real neighborly of you to
have me over the other day, but
I just gotta ask—you do know how
dressers work, right? Sorry, I know
it might not be my place, but I just
thought I'd send this along anyway.</message>
	<message label="112">Just wanted to send a note lettin'
you know how much I appreciate
you invitin' me over. Reckon I'm
startin' to learn what makes you
tick, kiddo. Anyway, I got you a
little somethin'. Hope you like it.</message>
