	<message label="101">Wow. I'm overwhelmed, kiddo.
I got every single one of your
messages—and the gifts too.
I'm touched you'd take the time
to reach out to a geezer like me.
Hope you like what I sent you.</message>
	<message label="102">To be honest, I haven't actually
finished readin' your messages,
because I'm savorin' each one.
You've been awful generous, both
with your time and your gifts, so
here's a little somethin' in return.</message>
	<message label="103">What's goin' on, kiddo? I know I'm
not the only one on this island, so
why am I the lucky recipient of so
many notes? I ain't complainin',
but I'm gettin' a bit spoiled here.
Anyway, I hope you like this gift.</message>
	<message label="104">I just had to write back and let
you know that I really appreciate
all the messages you've been
sendin' me. And I guess it's a sign
that I need to step up my game,
so I'm startin' with this note.</message>
	<message label="105">Just how many notes do you plan
on sendin' me, kiddo? My mailbox
is burstin' at the seams! I'd hate
to be readin' someone else's mail,
but keep these comin', if you did
mean to write me all these notes.</message>
	<message label="106">Thanks for all the notes, kiddo.
You really grabbed my heart and
shook it like a paint can. Guess I
could learn from you though...
I was tryin' for a metaphor, but I
ended up with a dadblasted simile.</message>
