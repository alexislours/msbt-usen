	<message label="101">Happy Valentine's Day, kiddo! I've
been keepin' this around to give to
someone special, and I've decided
that someone's you. Yeah, yeah,
I know. Just don't go gettin' all
sappy on me, y'hear?</message>
	<message label="102">Somehow Valentine's Day got the
drop on me. But I was ready with
my one-two punch: gifts and kind
words for those special to me. That
means you, kiddo! Thanks for bein'
you. Enjoy the present.</message>
	<message label="103">Now, I'll be the first to admit that
givin' out roses ain't my style—but
then again, it's Valentine's Day, an'
if ever there was a day for makin'
an exception... Anyhoo, I hope this
brings a smile to ya, kiddo.</message>
	<message label="104">I'm no good at this Valentine's Day
claptrap, so bear with me... Happy
Valentine's Day to a swell someone
in my life. That'd be you. Huh! That
didn't come out so bad! I reckon
you just inspire that in me.</message>
	<message label="105">This is a smidge too embarrassin'
for me to say out loud, so I wrote
it out on this Valentine's Day card
instead: thanks for always bein' so
kind and warm. I'm truly lucky to
know ya, kiddo!</message>
	<message label="106">I reckon you've got Valentine's Day
gifts pilin' up from here to the
stars. Well, have another! You're
too good a neighbor for me not to
celebrate, so I got you something
I hope you'll enjoy.</message>
	<message label="107">Seein' as it's Valentine's Day and
all, there's something I feel I don't
tell ya near enough: you're just
about the best neighbor this
<tag a="110" b="15" /> could ask for. Thank you
for bein' swell, <tag a="110" b="3" />.</message>
	<message label="108">How goes your Valentine's Day?
Told anyone how you feel about
'em yet? Not that I have, mind...
but I'm about to, right here in this
letter. Thanks for being a great
neighbor and an even greater pal.</message>
	<message label="109">I used to think it was crass to jam
all your feelings onto a piece of
paper instead of saying 'em out
loud, but here we are. I know most
times I seem grumpy, but I'm always
thankful I'm pals with you, kiddo.</message>
	<message label="201">Your pal, <tag a="110" b="10" /></message>
	<message label="202">Sincerely, <tag a="110" b="10" /></message>
