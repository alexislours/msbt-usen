	<message label="006">To my classy new neighbor,</message>
	<message label="101">It's real neighborly of you to send
a note so soon after I got here.
I was wonderin' whether the folks
on this island would take to a crank
like me, and at least one did!
Thanks, and I hope you like this.</message>
	<message label="102">You sure know how to welcome a
new fella, kiddo. Sendin' me a gift
was downright neighborly! I'm glad
as ever that I moved here, and
that's all thanks to you. Here...
Thought I'd return the favor. Enjoy!</message>
	<message label="103">If this is how you treat everyone
movin' to your island, I'm surprised
the place ain't packed to the gills!
Never had a warmer welcome—and
you even sent me a gift! I want you
to have this here in return. Enjoy!</message>
	<message label="104">What a surprise to get a note like
yours so soon after movin' here!
You sure know how to make an
old grump like me feel welcome!
If everyone else is as nice as you,
I think I'll do just fine livin' here.</message>
	<message label="105">Classy move, kiddo, sendin' me a
note like that right when I got here.
This ain't my first rodeo, but movin'
always takes a toll and you've
helped settle my jangly nerves.
I'm feelin' glad I moved here now.</message>
	<message label="106">You really caught me off guard with
that note you sent, kiddo. I mean,
here I am, new to the island, and
you're already welcomin' me with
open arms. I'm glad I came here,
and I hope we can get to be pals.</message>
