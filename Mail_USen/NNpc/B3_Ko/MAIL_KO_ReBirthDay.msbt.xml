	<message label="101">Thanks for sendin' that nice card
and birthday present. You really
went above and beyond, kiddo!
I didn't think they taught manners
anymore. Anyway, I got you a little
somethin' too. Hope you like it.</message>
	<message label="102">I just wanted to write to say thanks
for the birthday present. Don't tell
anyone, but you warmed my heart.
Gotta keep up my grouchy image!
Anyway, I got you a little somethin'
in return. You're the best, kiddo!</message>
	<message label="103">I was so surprised to get your
note and gift that I fell right outta
my chair! Well, after dustin' myself
off, I went out and got this by way
of thanks. You really know how to
warm an old crank's heart, kiddo.</message>
	<message label="104">Thanks a bunch for sendin' that
card for my birthday. You'd think
I'd be tired of celebratin' 'em, but
a day that's all about yours truly
never gets old! I appreciate your
gesture, kiddo. You're a good egg!</message>
	<message label="105">I really appreciate the card you
sent me for my birthday. You really
knocked me for a loop with that!
I might not be one for surprises,
but you sure did make my day.
Thanks a whole heap, kiddo!</message>
	<message label="106">I'm not the kinda guy who wants
folks to sing him a song in a
restaurant on his birthday. Might
even storm outta the place if that
ever happened. But your card was
real tasteful and touching. Thanks!</message>
