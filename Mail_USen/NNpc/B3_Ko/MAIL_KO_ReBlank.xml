	<message label="003">To my most confusing friend,</message>
	<message label="101">Maybe this is just me bein' old,
but did you mean to send me that
blank note on purpose, or is there
a message that went over my head?
Gimme a clue, kiddo, because I'm
honestly left in the dark here...</message>
	<message label="102">Thanks for sendin' me a card, even
though it seems like you forgot to
write a note. If you need any ideas,
you could tell me how much you
value my wisdom and look up to me
as a hero. You're welcome, kiddo!</message>
	<message label="103">That card you sent me recently
was blank! You tryin' to gaslight
me here? Or does it mean anythin'
that there ain't a message? Bah!
You're makin' my head spin, kiddo.
Let's try to stick to reality, OK?</message>
