	<message label="101">Just wanted to say thanks for the
visit. I don't get to host enough,
so that was fun. Oh, here's that
gift I couldn't give you at the time.
It's just a little thank-you present.
Anyway, let's do it again sometime!</message>
	<message label="102">Hope you had a good time at my
place. I'm kinda new to hostin', so
hopefully nothin' weird was left out
with my other clutter. Speakin' of,
here's a little somethin' to clutter
up your place too. Gahaha!</message>
	<message label="103">Thanks for the visit. You even got
me to tidy up my <tag a="110" b="15" />-sty!
If I could get you to come over on
a regular basis, my place might
even stay clean. Oh, and here's
that gift I owe you. Enjoy, OK?</message>
	<message label="104">Thanks again for stoppin' over!
You couldn't take this with you just
then, so I'm sendin' it now, just like
I said I would! Hey, uh... Right now,
as you're readin' this card... Your
pockets aren't still full, are they?</message>
