	<message label="101">I just heard about the new room.
Congrats! You wouldn't happen to
need a roommate, would you? Ha!
Just kidding. Maybe. Anyway, I got
you a little room-warming gift. It
ain't much, but I think you'll dig it.</message>
	<message label="102">Another room, eh? Awesome! So
what're you gonna do with it?
Home theater? Art studio? Extra-
huge laundry hamper? Whatever
you do, I can't wait to see it. Let's
hang out soon!</message>
	<message label="103">Your house is really getting huge!
I got you this as soon as I heard
about the new room. I figured with
all that extra space, you might
want some new clutter to cram
in there. Enjoy!</message>
	<message label="104">Your place seriously has a lot of,
um, place! Way to go! What're you
gonna do with all that room? How
about an indoor motorcycle track?
I bet the stairs would make a
wicked ramp! What do you think?</message>
