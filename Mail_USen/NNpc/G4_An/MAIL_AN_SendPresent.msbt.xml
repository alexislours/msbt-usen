	<message label="102">I went off to a class reunion, and
can you believe what I won in a
raffle? I'm never gonna need this
thing, but you might. If you don't,
feel free to sell it or give it away
or whatever. Up to you.</message>

wear this kinda thing all the time
back in my wild days (and low-key
still do sometimes) and I bet it'd

and let the stress melt away!</message>
