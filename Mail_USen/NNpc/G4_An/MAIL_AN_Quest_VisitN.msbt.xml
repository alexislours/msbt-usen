	<message label="101">Thanks for coming all the way out
to my pad to hang out. I can never
get enough company! But the real
reason I wrote was so I could send
you this gift before I forgot. One
more item off the to-do list!</message>
	<message label="102">The energy at my place got turned
all the way up when you got there!
I'd love to have you over again, so
don't be a stranger. There should
be a gift with this letter, so let me
know if it fell off somewhere.</message>
	<message label="103">Thanks for visiting! Remember how
I was gonna give you a present, but
your pockets were full? Well, I'm
sending it to you this way. Next
time you're passing by, stick your
head in and say hi!</message>
	<message label="104">Hey, so do you remember that thing
you were gonna take home but your
pockets were too full? Well, I kinda
forgot all about it...until I tripped
over it just now. Ow. Serves me
right, I guess. Anyway, here it is.</message>
