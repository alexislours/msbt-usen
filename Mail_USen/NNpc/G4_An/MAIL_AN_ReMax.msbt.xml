	<message label="101">Once you start writing, you just
can't stop, huh? When I saw all the
envelopes in my mailbox, I was
worried you might go broke from
the postage. But it was sweet of
you to put in the effort.</message>
	<message label="102">You should've seen how wide my
eyes went when I saw my mailbox
crammed full of your letters! It's
good to know you're thinking about
me so much. I only wrote you this
one card, but there's a gift with it!</message>
	<message label="103">That avalanche of letters you sent
had me SHOOK! And I don't faze
easy! It's cool, I guess, that I'm the
center of your world, but it feels
like a lot of responsibility. Is this
gift the right way to react?</message>
	<message label="104">Wow. You sent me SO MANY
letters! Maybe you should go plant
some trees or something. I read
'em all though. And when I was
done reading them, well, there
went the day! So many letters...</message>
	<message label="105">Usually, when my mailbox gets this
flooded, it's a bunch of junk mail.
But your letter storm was the
opposite of junk! I dunno what I
did to inspire your fit of letter
writing, but I'll try to keep it up!</message>
	<message label="106">My mailbox was so full, I think it
sunk a couple more inches into the
ground. How's your wrist after
writing all that? It took me a while
to get around to reading them all,
but it was totally worth it!</message>
