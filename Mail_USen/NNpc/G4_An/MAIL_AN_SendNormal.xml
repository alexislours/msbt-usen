	<message label="004">So get this, <tag a="110" b="3" />...</message>

	<message label="006">Hey, <tag a="110" b="3" />!</message>
	<message label="007">So, <tag a="110" b="3" />...</message>
	<message label="008">Guess what, <tag a="110" b="3" />?</message>
	<message label="009">Question for you, <tag a="110" b="3" />...</message>
	<message label="010">What's up, <tag a="110" b="3" />?!</message>
	<message label="101">My usual morning walk takes me
right by the post office, and this
morning I thought, hey—why not
write my buddy a letter? So I did.
It feels pretty good! You should
try writing one to me too!</message>
	<message label="102">You know I have no patience for
slacking off, but that ain't the same
thing as taking breaks. Even I can't
go 100% ALL the time. Something's
gonna give. Life's already tough,
so you don't gotta make it tougher!</message>
	<message label="103">I visited home a while back and got
to watch my cousin's kid. That little
rug rat is so stinkin' CUTE! I know
I got a tough reputation, which is
fair 'cause I'm tough, but little kids
just get me right there.</message>
	<message label="104">Last time I did the big spring
cleaning, I cleared out the closet
and found a whole pile of plushes
I forgot about. (I used to be scary
good at crane games.) I hate to
just throw 'em out... I mean...</message>
	<message label="105">There's a lot in this world you
COULD care about. But the only
thing worth caring about is friends.
If you don't have folks to hang out
with, or write letters to, what do
you really have? Nothing!</message>
	<message label="106">I went back to my hometown to
see my peeps from the old days.
Funny, I remember them as being
way wilder than they are now. But
I guess I've settled down too, huh?
Time'll do that to you.</message>
	<message label="107">Things haven't been too rosy for
me lately, but you don't see me
moping over it. That's 'cause I'm
thankful even for the bad times!
You take all that stuff and use it
for fertilizer, then see what blooms.</message>
	<message label="108">You ever see a photo of me when I
was younger? Me and all my friends
in pleather jackets with tons of
spikes and studs—all black, except
our hair, which was neon. Look,
I didn't invent the style.</message>
	<message label="109">I was working in my garden, and I
must've got carried away yelling at
the aphids and slugs and stuff,
'cause I looked up and saw one of
my neighbors running scared. Do I
have that effect on everyone?</message>
	<message label="110">I was all psyched up to send you a
letter, so I grabbed a pen and some
paper, sat down, and...right away
forgot what I was gonna write you
about. I'll write again if I remember,
so hang tight till then, OK?</message>
