	<message label="101">I wasn't expecting a card from
anyone so soon after I moved in.
And a present too! You're really
something. I wouldn't want to leave
you hanging, so here's a card back
and a present of my own.</message>
	<message label="102">Settling in to a new place can be
tough, but your letter (and the gift
too!) made it way easier. That was
real cool of you to do for someone
you barely know. So let's fix that
and get to know each other better!</message>
	<message label="103">Whew, you had me going. I thought
I had gotten one of those cut-and-
paste callouts first thing on moving
here. (Wouldn't be the first time.)
But it was way cooler than that!
Thanks for the pick-me-up!</message>
	<message label="104">There's a lot I haven't gotten used
to on this island, and I'll have to
add how friendly my new neighbors
are to the list! If everyone here is
as chill as you, I think I'm gonna
have a good time!</message>
	<message label="105">Thanks a bucketload for sending
me a welcome card! That's the kind
of passionate spirit I was hoping to
find in my new neighbors, and I'm
liking what I'm seeing so far. Can't
wait to get to know you better!</message>
	<message label="106">It was real nice of you to send me
that card! I've just moved in and I
already feel like I've made a friend.
I can be a little rough around the
edges, but don't let that throw you.
I can be nice too, sometimes! Ha!</message>
