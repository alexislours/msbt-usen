	<message label="002">Get a load of this, <tag a="110" b="3" />!</message>
	<message label="003">My best bud <tag a="110" b="3" />,</message>
	<message label="004"><tag a="50" b="3" /><tag a="110" b="3" /> to the bone,</message>
	<message label="005"><tag a="50" b="3" /><tag a="110" b="3" />, old buddy, old pal!</message>
	<message label="006">You are worthy, <tag a="110" b="3" />.</message>
	<message label="007">Hey, <tag a="110" b="3" />,</message>
	<message label="008">Sorry in advance, <tag a="110" b="3" />!</message>
	<message label="009">So, uh, <tag a="110" b="3" />...</message>
	<message label="010">Ready to rock, <tag a="110" b="3" />?</message>
	<message label="101">You ever hear that if you raise a
flower you planted yourself,
your wish'll come true when it
blooms? I kinda don't believe that,
but try it out on these and lemme
know what happens!</message>
	<message label="102">I went off to a class reunion, and
can you believe what I won in a
raffle? I'm never gonna need this
thing, but you might. If you don't,
feel free to sell it or give it away
or whatever. Up to you.</message>
	<message label="103">I saw these clothes for sale and
couldn't pass them up. I used to
wear this kinda thing all the time
back in my wild days (and low-key
still do sometimes) and I bet it'd
look rockin' on you.</message>
	<message label="104">You making sure to take some time
off to catch your breath? I talk a
lot about pushing yourself, but do
that too much and you'll burn out.
So lie down, put on some tunes,
and let the stress melt away!</message>
	<message label="105">Would you believe I found some
furniture I don't use anymore just
lying around? How do you LOSE a
whole piece of furniture? Life, I'm
telling you. Just be careful with it.
I don't know where it's been.</message>
	<message label="106">I had a buddy give me this a long,
long time ago. It's seen a lot of
action—a lot of good times and a
few bad. Now I'm passing it along
to you. Treat it right, or I'll know.</message>
	<message label="107">Ever impulse buy something you
just know you're never gonna use?
Like maybe it's on sale and it looks
cool, so you leap without thinking?
Who knows what was going through
my head...but my loss is your win!</message>
	<message label="108">I think everyone's got a relative
who's always buying them clothes
but has no idea what they like. My
aunt sent this cutesy thing, and...
that's not me. So she gets a thank-
you card, and you get the gear.</message>
	<message label="109">OK, I know how this looks, but I
promise I'm not trying to get all
mushy or anything. I'm sending
you pretty plants because I think
they look rad and that you might
think so too. And that's it.</message>
	<message label="110">These pants are awesome. You're
gonna love 'em. And I know that
they scream <tag a="110" b="10" />, but
they also scream <tag a="110" b="3" />
way, WAY louder. Enjoy!</message>
