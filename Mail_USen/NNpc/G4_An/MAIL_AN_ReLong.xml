	<message label="006">To my good bud <tag a="110" b="3" />,</message>
	<message label="101">I read the whole letter you wrote.
You sure poured your heart out
onto the page! Do you do that for
everyone you write to, or just me?
Either way, it moved me enough to
get you a little something!</message>
	<message label="102">Thanks for the rocking message!
Your intense letter-writing spirit hit
me right here. (I just pointed at my
heart.) I'm sending you a thing to
show my appreciation. I dunno if
you'll like it, but it's yours now!</message>
	<message label="103">I read your whole letter, front to
back! I can't believe you went to
all that trouble just for me. One
good turn deserves another, so
here's my best shot at a letter—
with a present to sweeten the pot!</message>
	<message label="104">Thanks for the loooooooong letter.
Hope your hand's OK after writing
all that! You need it for important
stuff like pulling weeds, or fixing
bikes, or arm wrestling. If any of
that sounds fun to you, hit me up!</message>
	<message label="105">Seeing your letter in my mailbox
made my entire day! Then when I
saw how much you wrote, it made
my whole WEEK! It was a good
read too. All the words were
spelled right and such. (I assume?)</message>
	<message label="106">That was a real strong letter you
sent. It felt like I was really there
listening to you talk. Which was
weird, 'cause I wasn't saying
anything back, you know? So that's
what this is. See you around!</message>
	<message label="201">Enjoy! –<tag a="110" b="10" /></message>
	<message label="202">Stay cool. –<tag a="110" b="10" /></message>
	<message label="203">So many words! –<tag a="110" b="10" /></message>
	<message label="204">Your handy pal, <tag a="110" b="10" /></message>
	<message label="205">Thanks, <tag a="110" b="10" /></message>
