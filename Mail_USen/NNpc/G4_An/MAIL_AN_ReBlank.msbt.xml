	<message label="101">You remembered the envelope, the
stamp, and the card, but you forgot
the part where you write something
in it. Wait, is this an invisible ink
thing? Do I need to hold it up to a
fire? Write back and let me know.</message>
	<message label="102">Hey, I got your...totally blank card?
Is everything OK? Could you not
find the words or what? If you need
help, just say the word, 'cause if
you're gettin' tossed on the stormy
seas of life, I wanna help!</message>
	<message label="103">Did you MEAN to send me a card
with nothing in it? Is it like, "Hey!
Have this free card!" If this is some
kinda prank, then that's weird, but
sure. But if it's not, then hey, free
card to write you back with!</message>
