	<message label="101">I got your letter and gift! I liked
that you let the present speak for
itself. I totally knew what you were
going for, and I liked knowing you
knew I'd know that. I bet you'll
figure out what this is about too.</message>
	<message label="102">Thanks for the present! The short
note you sent with it made it seem
like a mystery, and opening up the
gift felt like solving it. I thought
you might like that feeling too, so
I sent you this in return. Or did I?!</message>
	<message label="103">There weren't a lot of words in that
letter, but I could tell you picked
every one of them carefully. That's
some talent you got! Thanks for
thinking of me, and here's a thing
to show I'm thinking of you too.</message>
	<message label="104">Got your message. Short, sweet
and to the point. Not bad. Gave me
some ideas. Think I'll try it for
myself. It's already getting long
though. I need a sign-off too?
This is harder than it looks.</message>
	<message label="105">Thanks for the letter! You know
how to keep it short and sweet,
huh? That might have backfired
though... It was SO short that I
read it over and over, trying to find
hidden meanings!</message>
	<message label="106">Thanks for the letter. It didn't take
long to read, which was cool. Can't
stand when people won't get to the
point about stuff! Hmm, I should
follow my own advice, huh? Yeah,
this letter's over now!</message>
	<message label="201">Good luck! –<tag a="110" b="10" /></message>
