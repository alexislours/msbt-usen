	<message label="101">How did you get me the PERFECT
birthday gift?! Are you a mind-
reader or something? It was the
top pick on the list I never wrote
down anywhere! Anyway, I liked it
so much, I got you something too.</message>
	<message label="102">I'll come out and say it—your gift
was so good that I got a little misty
over it. I must've done something
right in life to have a friend like
you. It means so much to me that
I got you this in return.</message>
	<message label="103">Ain't no party like a birthday party,
'cause a birthday party don't stop
making you feel surrounded by
folks who care about you. Wow,
that got real. Can't wait for next
year's! Thanks for coming!</message>
	<message label="104">Thanks for the birthday present!
It's just what I would've gotten for
myself. I can tell that you GET me!
I decided to get you a birthday gift
too, but you know me and patience
don't mix, so here it is now.</message>
	<message label="105">I was pretty stoked to open that
gift you got me. I can tell you put
some thought into it! That's the
kind of thing that gives me a warm,
fuzzy feeling inside. So I thought
I'd do my best to return the favor!</message>
	<message label="106">Thanks for the birthday present!
I wasn't expecting much, so to get
something so cool blew me away.
Usually the birthday gal doesn't
GIVE presents, but since when do I
care about the usual? Here ya go!</message>
