	<message label="101">Here's your prize from the game we
played a while back. You were way
better than I expected...did you
hustle me?! Either way, I had fun.
But I'm not gonna lose twice, so
watch yourself!</message>
	<message label="102">I sent you the fruit you couldn't
hold after our game. What a match!
You really had me going there.
But I go hard on most things, so
big surprise, right? Anyway, we
should hang out again soon!</message>
	<message label="103">I couldn't give you this fruit at the
time, so I'm sending it to you now.
And if you ever feel like a winner-
take-all rematch, there's more fruit
where that came from! Better bring
your A game if you want it!</message>
