	<message label="101">So, 'cause today's Valentine's Day,
I decided to go all out and get you
something real special. You've
always been a total rock star to
me, so I wanna make sure I treat
you like one today. Enjoy!</message>
	<message label="102">Happy Valentine's Day! So check
it out—I made sweets, and they're
actually good! I know, right? Bwa
ha ha! Anyway, I was so proud,
I just had to share. Call it my
thanks for always being rad.</message>
	<message label="103">We're pals, right? I mean, of course
we are. But, like, forever pals. Well,
I feel we are, which is why I got
you something I think you'll like.
'Cause if we're in it forever, we
gotta be good to each other, right?</message>
	<message label="104">Were you surprised? Yup! You
were. Let's keep it going. I got you
chocolate 'cause it's Valentine's
Day! Are you gonna love it? Yeah,
you will. Isn't being my pal great?
I think you know the answer.</message>
	<message label="105">Didja think I'd forget about you on
Valentine's Day? Come on! You're
like the island rock star. No way I'd
forget! And to prove it, I got you
something I think—I mean, KNOW—
that you're gonna love.</message>
	<message label="106">OK, so I thought I'd try making
chocolate. I know, I know. Really
bad idea. But get this: it came out
awesome! Anyway, I'm sending you
some for... Oh, hey, it's Valentine's
Day. Huh! Well, that worked out!</message>
	<message label="107">I'm sending out chocolate to some
of my favorite folks, and guess
what? You made the list (as if there
was any doubt)! Thanks for always
being so chill. I can NEVER have
too much of that in my life.</message>
	<message label="108">Happy Valentine's Day! So, I was
thinking... What do you get for the
neighbor who deserves everything?
Then it hit me. You can never have
too much chocolate. And here we
are! Enjoy your chocolate!</message>
	<message label="109">Why do folks think Valentine's Day
gifts have to mean, like, STUFF?
I mean, what if I just wanna give
something awesome to someone
I think is awesome? What I'm saying
is, you're awesome. Enjoy!</message>
