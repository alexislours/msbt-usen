	<message label="006"><tag a="50" b="3" /><tag a="110" b="3" />, you go-getter,</message>
	<message label="101">Thanks for taking the time to find a
present for me. And with a nice
card too! I dunno how you do it,
but you always seem to find a way
to look after your pals. Makes me
glad to be one of them!</message>
	<message label="102">You managed to send out cards in
the holiday season?! I wish I could
be as together as you! All that and
a present on top...you're gonna
make everyone look bad! Not me
though. I got your gift right here.</message>
	<message label="103">Ah, the classic card-present
combo. Nice. I know it's supposed
to be the least you can do for
a friend at the holidays, but not
everyone can pull it off. Lucky for
you I always go the extra mile!</message>
	<message label="104">Your card made me more sure than
ever that this next year is gonna
rock! I've got a to-do list as long
as my arm and you know what? I
think I'm gonna get to all of it this
time. You and me, buddy! Let's go!</message>
	<message label="105">You sure are on top of things, with
your holiday cards in people's
mailboxes and not in a stack on
your kitchen table. It inspired me
to start getting things done, and
the proof is in your hands now!</message>
	<message label="106">Thanks for the holiday card! The
next year's just around the corner,
so it's a good time to start getting
fired up about it! But not TOO fired
up. I'm trying to take it easy a little
this year, to see how it feels.</message>
