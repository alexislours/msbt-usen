	<message label="101">The little game we played earlier
was rather fun, wasn't it? Here's
your prize, as promised. Feel free
to eat the fruit, or plant it, or wear
it as a hat! Whatever floats your
boat, darling. It's all yours!</message>
	<message label="102">I had so much fun yesterday!
I should have known you'd be aces
at that game! Before I forget, I'm
sending you the prize. I have more
fruit ready and waiting, so let's
play again soon, darling!</message>
	<message label="103">Here's that fruit I couldn't give you
earlier, and a card to go with it.
That game was fun, wasn't it?
I must say, playing games with
you was quite exciting. What can
I say...I'm a thrill seeker!</message>
