	<message label="101">Having you over for a visit was
such a delight. You brightened up
my whole day! Now, before I forget,
I'm sending you the gift you
weren't able to carry home. May it
brighten your day in return!</message>
	<message label="102">Did you enjoy your visit to my
house? Next time you come over,
I'll be sure to give the place a
good cleaning beforehand. Oh, and
here's the gift I wanted to give you
earlier. I do hope you enjoy it!</message>
	<message label="103">Thank you for coming over to visit!
I do love to play host. You had your
hands full so I couldn't give you
your present, remember? Well, here
it is. Don't get too excited. It's just
a little something from me to you!</message>
	<message label="104">Thank you again for the lovely
visit. Here is the item I said you
could have but you couldn't carry
at the time. Now, I only sold it with
the understanding that you would
take good care of it. Treat it well!</message>
