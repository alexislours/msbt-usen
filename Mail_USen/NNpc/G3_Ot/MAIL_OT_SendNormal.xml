	<message label="101">I had the strangest dream! In it, I
was writing an important letter to
you. Alas, when I awoke, I couldn't
remember what the letter was
about! I guess we'll never know.
Anyhoo, hope this finds you well.</message>
	<message label="102">I was out for a stroll when, quite
suddenly, you sprang to my mind.
I had this powerful feeling I should
write you. And so I have! I don't
have much to say, but I do hope
my letter has brightened your day!</message>
	<message label="103">I started writing this message
because I had something to tell
you. But now, all of a sudden, I'm
drawing a complete blank! It's
quite embarrassing, but I shall
send this letter to you anyway!</message>
	<message label="104">I want you to know that you are a
fabulous friend, and I appreciate
you for being you. Sometimes
I forget to say it, darling, but I want
you to know that I think it often.
I am lucky to have you as a friend!</message>
	<message label="105">I just have to tell you about this
FAB dream I had! In it, I became
a world-famous fashion designer.
I was SO popular that celebrities
fought over me! Do you think this
dream foretold my future? Say yes!</message>
	<message label="106">I do enjoy craft projects, don't
you? Focusing oneself on making
something beautiful is a wonderful
stress reliever. And finishing it is
so very fulfilling. The hard part is
deciding which project to start!</message>
	<message label="107">I was about to catch the most
exquisite bug, but it eluded me at
the very last second! I know I
shouldn't give up, but I'm terribly
frustrated! Thank you for letting
me vent, darling. You're the best!</message>
	<message label="108">I'm writing to you because we get
along so well. Also, I wanted to tell
you that I value open and honest
communication. So please, if
anything ever comes to mind, feel
free to talk to me. I'm here for you!</message>
	<message label="109">Do you ever feel down in the
dumps? I certainly do! When
that happens, I like to rearrange
my room. It's refreshing—and
empowering—to reshape the world
around you. Go on! Give it a try!</message>
	<message label="110">Is there anything better than
receiving a letter from someone
out of the blue? I think not! It
makes my heart pitter-patter with
excitement. I hope this letter has
done the same for you!</message>
