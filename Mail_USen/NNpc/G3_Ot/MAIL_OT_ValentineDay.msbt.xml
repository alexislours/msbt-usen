	<message label="101">Happy Valentine's Day! I'm ever
so thankful for our friendship,
especially today. I must confess,
I got you a small something. I do
hope it finds you well, darling.
May you have a lovely day!</message>
	<message label="102">Happy Valentine's Day! Oh, I must
say...this holiday does make my
heart flutter like a butterfly. Now,
I wasn't quite sure what to get you,
but I do hope this surprises and
delights, darling.</message>
	<message label="103">How could I have known that we
would become such friends,
confidantes, or "besties," as some
might say? Darling, I couldn't have
predicted it, but I'm so happy that
we have. Please accept this.</message>
	<message label="104">I'm just writing to say thank you
for always being such a kind friend
to me. Valentine's Day comes but
once a year, so I'm sending a little
something special with this missive.
I hope it finds you well!</message>
	<message label="105">You do know that today is special,
don't you? It's Valentine's Day, and
we must tell the folks dearest to
us just how we feel. So! I want to
remind you how thankful I am for
your friendship. This is for you!</message>
	<message label="106">Happy Valentine's Day! I'm quite
sure you've received many letters
much like this one. And each and
every one well deserved! Still, I
hope this one finds a special place
in your heart, as you have in mine.</message>
	<message label="107">Happy Valentine's Day! You're so
kind to me, so I'm giving you a little
something in return. I hope our
friendship continues to blossom
like a drop of red food coloring in
seltzer. Yes, that simile will do.</message>
	<message label="108">It's Valentine's Day, and that means
I am cutting loose with exclamation
points in all my cards! I hope this
one finds you well, and I have
attached a small token of my
appreciation for you! Enjoy!</message>
	<message label="109">You always make my day brighter,
so I hope this note makes your
Valentine's Day just a smidgen
more luminous. Please accept a
small token of my friendship. It's
very nearly the least I can do!</message>
