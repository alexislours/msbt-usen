	<message label="003">To my mysterious <tag a="110" b="3" />,</message>
	<message label="101">I'm utterly baffled! The letter you
sent me—it didn't have a single
thing written in it! Did you use
some kind of invisible ink? Is there
a secret code? Perhaps I've
watched too many spy movies.</message>
	<message label="102">What is the meaning of this?! You
send a letter with nothing written
in it...and I'm supposed to know
what that means? While I like a
joke as much as the next gal, this
isn't so much funny as it is foolish.</message>
	<message label="103">What is the meaning of this letter
with no words in it? Do you mean
to suggest that words are
unnecessary when it comes to a
friendship such as ours? Why, yes!
I see! And I agree wholeheartedly!</message>
