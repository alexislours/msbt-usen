	<message label="101">My word! I was amazed to find my
mailbox overflowing when I arrived
home! Writing all of those letters
must have been no easy task...even
for you. So much effort just for me!
Here, please take this as thanks!</message>
	<message label="102">I must admit, I was rather shocked
to find that you had thought so
much about me! I'm sending a little
thank-you gift for your many notes.
Just one, though! But please
imagine I sent it to you many times!</message>
	<message label="103">I finally finished reading all of your
letters! Quite the writer, aren't
you? You have enough words to
overflow a mailbox! I'm impressed,
darling. I've sent a gift to thank
you for thinking so much of me.</message>
	<message label="104">I finally finished reading all of the
messages you sent me. I'm moved,
darling! Truly! Though I confess, I
was rather taken aback to find my
mailbox stuffed so full it wouldn't
close—but it was a lovely surprise!</message>
	<message label="105">I was struck speechless when I
opened my mailbox and a huge pile
of letters poured out! Your hand
must be terribly tired from writing
so much! I'm still rather shocked,
but I appreciate your kind gesture.</message>
	<message label="106">You're such a passionate writer to
fire off so many letters all at once!
I read each and every one from top
to bottom, and I loved them all. I'd
write more, but I'm struggling here
to finish even one letter! Oh well!</message>
