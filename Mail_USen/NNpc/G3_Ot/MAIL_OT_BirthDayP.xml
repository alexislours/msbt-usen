	<message label="101">Happy birthday again! I'm sending
along the present you couldn't
take home from the party. If I know
you—and I think I do—it'll suit your
tastes quite nicely. Well, my dear,
here's to another wonderful year!</message>
	<message label="102">Here's the gift I meant to give you
at your party. A birthday without a
present is like cake without the
frosting! And we can't have that!
Anyway, I selected it myself, so
rest assured it's fabulous.</message>
	<message label="103">Happy birthday, my dear! Here's
your present. I know it's a wee
bit late, but not to worry... It simply
means we can celebrate your
birthday even longer! May your
next 365 days be utterly marvelous!</message>
	<message label="104">Happy birthday! I'm so glad you
enjoyed the party. Breaking open
a piñata is quite thrilling, isn't it?
Anyhoo, as promised, I'm sending
along the cupcakes you couldn't
take home with you. They're delish!</message>
	<message label="105">I hope you had fun at the party!
I'm sending you the cupcakes from
the piñata. You can share them
with friends...or eat them all
yourself. It's up to you, darling.
Just listen to your stomach. Ha!</message>
	<message label="106">I never tire of attending birthday
parties. I already can't wait for
your next one! Here are the piñata
cupcakes I promised to send. Now,
don't eat too many. Oh, never mind
that. Go ahead and live a little!</message>
	<message label="107">You are such a gem for sharing
your birthday cupcakes with me!
And I'm sorry it's a teensy bit late,
but here's the present I couldn't
give you earlier. I don't know if it'll
be to your liking, but give it a whirl!</message>
	<message label="108">I wanted to thank you for earlier.
When you shared your birthday
cupcake with me, well, it felt like a
real bonding moment. Anyhoo, I'm
sending along the present you
couldn't carry. I think you'll like it!</message>
	<message label="109">Happiest of birthdays, darling!
I'm sending you the present you
couldn't carry earlier. I do hope
you like it! Tell me, what did the
others get you? Anything exciting?
A pair of socks, perhaps? Ha!</message>
