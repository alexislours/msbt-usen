	<message label="101">I've got a little present for you.
It's nothing too extravagant, but I
think it's just the thing. Add this
stylish new eyewear to your regular
ensemble and...voilà! All eyes will
be on your new look, darling. Ha!</message>
	<message label="102">You know, it's not good for your
eyes to work in the dark. That goes
for reading, studying, playing
games...all of it! Which is why I got
you this! I hope it helps when you
find yourself up into the wee hours.</message>
	<message label="103">Taking time to wash away the day's
stress is so rejuvenating, don't you
think? And you, my dear, are always
working so hard. So, I thought this
might help you unwind! I do hope
you find it refreshing.</message>
	<message label="104">Versatile items are the key to any
wardrobe. And so I've sent you
this! It's heavy enough to keep you
warm but light enough you won't be
TOO warm. It'll be useful—and
stylish—throughout the year!</message>
	<message label="105">Having a little greenery in your
home can do wonders, don't you
think? I've found that plants are
excellent stress relievers. Which is
why I sent this to you! I just know
you'll feel the results right away!</message>
	<message label="106">You know how I have a weakness
for bath items? Well, I went
shopping a bit ago, and when I saw
this I HAD to buy it. Alas, it seems
I thought the same thing last time I
saw it. Well, it's yours now, darling!</message>
	<message label="107">I've been searching for a new
owner for this flooring for so long.
But no more! The new owner is...
YOU! Congratulations! This must be
destiny, mustn't it? Your floors
were destined to look fabulous!</message>
	<message label="108">I got worried all of a sudden about
whether you were sleeping well.
When it comes to looking our best,
sleep is terribly important. Soooo,
I'm sending you a REM-friendly
deep-sleep prezzie!</message>
	<message label="109">As island life becomes normal life,
we lose that vacation-in-paradise
feeling. But spending time at the
beach will help you remember it!
I hope this gift encourages you
to stick your toes in the sand.</message>
	<message label="110">To be truly fashionable, one must
think of the less-obvious and even
unseen details. I've sent you a little
something few will see, but you will
know to be there. Wear them
with pride!</message>
