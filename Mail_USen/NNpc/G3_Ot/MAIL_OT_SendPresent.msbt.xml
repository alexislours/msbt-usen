It's nothing too extravagant, but I
think it's just the thing. Add this
stylish new eyewear to your regular
ensemble and...voilà! All eyes will
be on your new look, darling. Ha!</message>
	<message label="102">You know, it's not good for your
eyes to work in the dark. That goes
for reading, studying, playing
games...all of it! Which is why I got
you this! I hope it helps when you
find yourself up into the wee hours.</message>

stress is so rejuvenating, don't you
think? And you, my dear, are always
working so hard. So, I thought this
might help you unwind! I do hope
you find it refreshing.</message>
	<message label="104">Versatile items are the key to any
wardrobe. And so I've sent you
this! It's heavy enough to keep you
warm but light enough you won't be
TOO warm. It'll be useful—and
stylish—throughout the year!</message>
	<message label="105">Having a little greenery in your
home can do wonders, don't you
think? I've found that plants are
excellent stress relievers. Which is
why I sent this to you! I just know
you'll feel the results right away!</message>
