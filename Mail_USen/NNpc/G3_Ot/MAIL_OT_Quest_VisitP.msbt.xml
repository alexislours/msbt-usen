	<message label="012">Thank you, <tag a="110" b="3" />!</message>
	<message label="101">Thank you for letting me visit the
other day! Your home was so
wonderfully, uniquely YOU! Here is
a little token of my gratitude.
It's a little something I thought you
might like based on what I saw.</message>
	<message label="102">It was so kind of you to have me
over, darling. I hope you enjoy this
thank-you gift! I also hope that,
someday soon, you let me see
what's inside that secret room of
yours. The suspense is killing me!</message>
	<message label="103">Thank you for having me over. What
a delight it was to see your place.
It was so full of your unique...
<tag a="110" b="3" />-ness! Of course,
things do tend to pile up quickly,
so perhaps you'll find this helpful.</message>
	<message label="104">What a delightful visit to your home
that was! I was most intrigued by
your daring furniture arrangements.
So...unorthodox! You do know how
to make a statement, darling.
Now please, take this gift. I insist!</message>
	<message label="105">Your home—what can I say? Thank
you for allowing me to visit. Now,
about that room... So austere!
Like a prison cell...in a monastery.
Darling, even a minimalist such as
yourself needs one of these, yes?</message>
	<message label="106">What a pleasant surprise it was to
visit your home! So comfortable!
So stylish! So YOU! I don't say this
lightly...I was impressed! Here's a
little something for having me over.
Let's do it again soon, shall we?</message>
	<message label="107">I quite enjoyed visiting your home.
But a note—they say the walls of a
house are like the canvas of a
painting. And your canvas, darling,
is empty. So, here! Let's get those
decorative juices flowing, shall we?</message>
	<message label="108">You know me, I just HAD to send a
thank-you gift. It's nothing too
fancy, mind you. You have so many
rare items... How could I compete
with that?! This gift is just a simple
thank-you for having me over.</message>
	<message label="109">Your home—it was fabulous! The
very lap of luxury! Thank goodness
green looks good on me, because
I'm the picture of envy. I've sent a
thank-you gift for having me over.
I do hope it meets your standards.</message>
	<message label="110">How pleasant it was to visit your
home! Your understated approach
to interior design—so tidy! Though,
I must say, you could use a touch
more furniture, darling. Please, try
filling the empty space with this.</message>
	<message label="111">Thank you for having me to your
home. It was quite...something!
Who knew you could fit so many
things in one space! A thought
occurred—perhaps my friend could
use some storage. Try this, darling.</message>
	<message label="112">Visiting your home was a pleasure!
As you know, interior design is a
passion of mine, so I loved seeing
what you did with the place. Very
interesting indeed. Now, here's a
little gift from yours truly. Enjoy!</message>
