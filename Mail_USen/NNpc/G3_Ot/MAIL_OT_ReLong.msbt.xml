your heart and soul into it, didn't
you? Such a beautiful outpouring.
Anything I send you will pale in
comparison, but here is a gift that
I hope expresses my gratitude.</message>

so much feeling into has filled my
own heart to overflowing. So many
words just for me! Thank you!
Please accept this in return,
darling. I insist!</message>

the fire in you to write such a
long and passionate letter! I can't
hope to match the fervor of your
writing with a simple gift, but I must
express my thanks somehow!</message>

over since receiving it. I don't
know how to thank you for having
written such a very long letter just
for me! I can only promise to
cherish each and every word.</message>
	<message label="105">I received your message and I must
confess, I was taken aback by the
power of your many, many words!
It's refreshing to see you express
yourself so freely. Let the words
inside flow forth like a river!</message>
	<message label="106">That was quite a flood of words you
unleashed in your recent letter!
Only you could be so bold and
forthright, my dear. Well, one
thing's for sure... You've given me
a lot to think about.</message>
