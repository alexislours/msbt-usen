	<message label="101">Congratulations on your new home
expansion! I'm sending you a little
gift to encourage you on. I'd be
tickled if you used it to decorate
your fancy new room, darling.</message>

I envy all the fun you'll have
decorating so much space! I got
this gift to show you how much I
admire what you've done. I do hope
it fits the design of your new room.</message>
	<message label="103">Your house keeps getting bigger
and bigger! I had to get a present
for my diligent little dynamo. With
so many rooms, it must be hard to
decide what goes where! What I
wouldn't give to have that problem!</message>

your home deserves respect! To a
wonderful friend with a wonderful
home, I hope you find this little
