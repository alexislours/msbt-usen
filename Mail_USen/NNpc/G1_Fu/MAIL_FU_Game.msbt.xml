	<message label="101">I had fun playing High Card, Low
Card with you. Here's that fruit I
couldn't give you then... I wanted
to make sure you got your winnings
delivered to you. Let's try to play
together again soon, OK?</message>
	<message label="102">Here's your prize from our recent
game of High Card, Low Card. Hope
you had fun playing, because I did.
You really challenged me and made
things interesting! What would you
say to a re-match sometime soon?</message>
	<message label="103">I'm sending along your winnings
from our recent game of High Card,
Low Card. What'll you do with this
fruit, I wonder? I think I might've
baked something with it if I'd won.
Maybe some kind of pie or a tart?</message>
