	<message label="101">Thanks so much for your gift, and
for taking the time to enclose a
brief note. Any word from you is
always welcome! I'm sending along
this small gift for you in return.
Hopefully it's something you like.</message>
	<message label="102">Your gift was such a nice surprise!
Thank you for that, and for the
sweet message that you included.
I wanted to follow your example,
so I picked up a little something
that I could send with this note.</message>
	<message label="103">You didn't say much in your note,
but your gift was so thoughtful
that you really didn't need to say
anything. I've tried to send a gift
that's nearly as well-chosen as
yours, but I'm not sure how I did.</message>
	<message label="104">You're really good at expressing
yourself. Even the briefest note
from you gets across how you
were feeling when you sat down
to write. That's a rare skill that
I wish I could pick up from you.</message>
	<message label="105">You managed to say so much in
your latest note without needing
to ramble on and on. Sometimes
I worry that my writing is just a
bunch of space-filling nonsense.
You must never worry about that.</message>
	<message label="106">What's that type of poetry called,
that's really brief but packed with
meaning? Anyway, that's how your
note to me read. You're a master
at expressing yourself concisely.
You should teach your style to me!</message>
