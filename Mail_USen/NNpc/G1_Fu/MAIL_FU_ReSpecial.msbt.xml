	<message label="101">Thanks so much for the gift. How
were you able to guess my size?
Seems like you must know me even
better than I thought you did! I'm
returning the favor with something
I think should look good on you.</message>
	<message label="102">I love wearing what you sent me,
so I thought I'd try picking out a
little something for you. Can you
believe we're actually exchanging
clothes now? We've reached an
exciting new level of friendship!</message>
	<message label="103">I was so impressed that you were
able to find something that looks
great on me. Thank you so much!
I'm not sure I was as successful,
but let me know what you think
after you try this on for size.</message>
	<message label="104">Thank you for the unexpected gift!
You really have great taste in home
furnishings! I'm enclosing a little
something that I hope will look as
good in your place. I'd love for you
to share decorating tips sometime.</message>
	<message label="105">You sent something for my home,
so I'm returning the favor. Hey,
swapping furnishings like this is
kind of fun, isn't it? I hope we can
keep on doing this, because you
have really great decorating ideas!</message>
	<message label="106">How were you able to guess the
exact thing I'd been thinking about
getting for my home? Are you some
kind of mind reader? I picked out
something to thank you, but I don't
know that I read your mind as well.</message>
	<message label="107">You did a great job picking out
the kind of furniture I would like,
because you sent me something
I already have! I appreciate your
gesture, and I'm sending you
something in return. Thank you!</message>
	<message label="108">I noticed how good your present
smelled before I'd even had a
chance to unwrap it. What a treat!
Thank you so much. I tried to pick
out a gift as delectable as yours,
so I hope this is up to your taste.</message>
	<message label="109">Thank you for the lovely gift!
I haven't planted them because
I'm trying to learn everything
about that species before I do.
They've inspired lots of flowery
daydreaming in the meantime!</message>
	<message label="110">I really love this adorable little
seedling that you sent me! I've
been pampering it indoors, but
I guess I should probably pick a
place to plant it outside before
it's too big to fit through my door.</message>
	<message label="111">It's always nice to get mail, but
I really appreciated your generous
gift! You really shouldn't have…
Still, I thought I should return the
gesture and pick out a gift for you.
Hope this is something you'll like.</message>
	<message label="112">This music you sent me is really
catchy! I've been listening to it
since I got your mail. You inspired
me to send you some music that
I like, and see if you have similar
taste. Let me know what you think!</message>
	<message label="113">Thank you for sending me such a
practical gift! What a great idea.
I'll definitely think of you every
time that I use this! Here—I picked
out a little something for you as
well, to show my appreciation.</message>
	<message label="118">This fossil you sent me is great!
It has me imagining what it would
have been like to see this island
in its prehistoric past. I'm sending
back a little something for you,
but my present is from this era.</message>
	<message label="119">I tried to guess what you could've
sent me that would be so heavy,
but I never came close to guessing
"freshly dug-up fossil!" You really
come up with unique gift ideas!
I hope you like what I sent you.</message>
	<message label="120">Thanks for the gift! Did you know
I have something like this hanging
in my home right now? They do say
that you can never have too much
of a good thing! I picked this out
for you in return. Hope you like it!</message>
	<message label="121">Your gift was such a nice surprise!
I've been trying to find the best
way to thank you for it, and this is
what I chose to send you in return.
Do you like it? It's so fun to have
someone I can trade gifts with!</message>
