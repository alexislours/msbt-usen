	<message label="101">You probably didn't mean to, but
you mailed a note to me without
anything written on it. I tried to
treat it as a mystery that I had to
solve, and guess at what you'd
meant to say. But I'm at a loss…</message>
	<message label="102">That blank note you sent to me was
part of some puzzle you wanted me
to solve, right? Of course it was…
Otherwise, I've just been wasting
my time struggling to figure it out.
I think I've almost got this solved!</message>
	<message label="103">I've been using all kinds of tricks
to try to find the invisible message
in that blank note you sent to me…

it, heating the note, and putting it
under a black light. I'll keep trying.</message>
