island, but your gift made me feel
so welcome! I want you to know
how grateful I am for your sweet
gesture, and I hope you'll accept
this present from me in return.</message>
	<message label="102">Thank you for your welcome gift!
Is it that obvious that I'm still not
totally settled in here? Either way,
that was really thoughtful of you.
I'm enclosing something for you
so I can return your kindness.</message>
	<message label="103">Your thoughtful gift made me feel
so welcome here on this island!

that's all thanks to you. I hope
you'll let me give you this present
in return to show my appreciation.</message>

here, I already have a note from
you to make me feel welcome!
I'm really grateful that you wrote
to me. I just hope everyone else
feels like I'm that approachable!</message>
	<message label="105">There's so much to get used to
after moving to a new place.
Your note made me feel that, for
the first time, this really is going
to be my home. I hope this means
the two of us will be good friends!</message>
	<message label="106">It was so sweet of you to send me
a note welcoming me to my new

to know everyone on the island!</message>
