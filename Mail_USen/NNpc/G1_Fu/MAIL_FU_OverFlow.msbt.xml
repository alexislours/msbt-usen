	<message label="101">Here's what I wanted to give you
earlier, to show my appreciation
for what you did for me. Remember
how you didn't have a free hand to
take it home? Anyway, here it is
along with my gratitude and love.</message>
	<message label="102">As promised, here's what I wasn't
able to give you previously, when
you couldn't carry my gift home.
This small token of my appreciation
can't match your generosity, but I
hope I chose something you like.</message>
	<message label="103">Here's what I meant to give you
earlier! I really do hope you like it.
In retrospect, I'm actually glad
your pockets were full before, so
I could include this note to remind
you how much I appreciate you!</message>
