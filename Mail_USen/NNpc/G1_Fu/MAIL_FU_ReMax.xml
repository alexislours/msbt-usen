	<message label="006">Hi, <tag a="110" b="3" />!</message>
	<message label="101">Wow, you've been writing so much
lately, and as if that wasn't enough,
you've been sending gifts! I don't
know what I've done to deserve all
this generosity, but sending you a
gift in return seemed only right.</message>
	<message label="102">I was surprised to get all these
notes and gifts from you lately.
What a nice surprise though!
It wouldn't be a surprise if I did
the same thing, but I did want to
send you this by way of thanks.</message>
	<message label="103">Are you sending all these notes
and gifts to everyone else on
the island, or should I feel extra
special for getting so much of
your attention lately? Thank you,
and please have this in return.</message>
	<message label="104">My mailbox has been overflowing
with messages from you lately!
I'm not complaining, but you do
know you can find me anytime to
chat in person, right? I'm teasing...
Keep writing whenever you want!</message>
	<message label="105">I usually like to display cards and
other mail I get from friends, but
I'm going to need a bigger place
if I want to show off everything
you've been sending me lately!
Thank you! I love getting mail.</message>
	<message label="106">I never expected to get so much
reading material by mail from you!
I was so excited that I read through
everything you sent in one sitting!
Now I wish I'd paced myself and
tried to spread the fun out more.</message>
