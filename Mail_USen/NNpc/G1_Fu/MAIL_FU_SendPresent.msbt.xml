	<message label="003">Between us two, <tag a="110" b="3" />,</message>
	<message label="004">So, <tag a="110" b="3" />, I was thinking...</message>
	<message label="005">What do you think, <tag a="110" b="3" />?</message>
	<message label="006">Sharing is caring, <tag a="110" b="3" />!</message>
	<message label="007">Something for <tag a="110" b="3" />:</message>
	<message label="008">Dear <tag a="110" b="3" />,</message>
	<message label="009">To the always-fresh <tag a="110" b="3" />,</message>
	<message label="010"><tag a="50" b="3" /><tag a="110" b="3" />, I've been thinking...</message>
	<message label="101">One of my favorite things to do is
to relax at home and sip a nice, hot
beverage. I thought I might send
something to help you do the same.
Now your home can feel like a café!
I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.</message>
	<message label="102">Even if you've already got a clock,
I thought you might like another.
I like to keep two clocks around,
myself. It gives me peace of mind,
since at least one is bound to keep
telling time even if the other stops.</message>
	<message label="103">I can't resist buying anything that
makes my home feel like a library.
The problem is that sometimes I'll
mess up and buy things I already
own. Would you be willing to take
this so I don't have to feel silly?</message>
	<message label="104">I saw something in the store that I
liked, but I thought it would look so
much better on you. I went ahead
and bought this because I want to
see if I'm right. If you do like it, I'd
love to have you model it for me.</message>
	<message label="105">I'm obsessed with cooking, so I'm
picky about what I keep around to
cook with. I recently did a bit of a
kitchen update, and wondered if
this was something you could use?
I hope you love it as much as I did.</message>
	<message label="106">I was doing a little recreational
organizing last weekend and came
across this light. It's just gathering
dust here, but I thought it might
brighten up your place. I hope you
like it! If not...well, sorry.</message>
	<message label="107">Surprise! It's a rug! I read a short
story about a flying carpet recently
and bought this in a moment of
literary impulse—my biggest vice.
No, the rug can't fly. But it can be
the backbone of great home decor.</message>
	<message label="108">Giving a gift in person can feel so
casual. Sending this item via snail
mail seemed more appropriate
somehow. What's more charming
than a well-wrapped package? The
handpicked gift inside, I hope!</message>
	<message label="109">I've been waiting for the perfect
moment to send you a surprise
present. I picked this out for you
after hemming and hawing for five
hours. I really, really hope you like
it. If not, please don't tell me.</message>
	<message label="110">We could take our friendship to the
next level if we had a shared
interest. You know I have a weak
spot for handicrafts. This gift
is my best attempt to convert you
to my craft-happy ways.</message>
