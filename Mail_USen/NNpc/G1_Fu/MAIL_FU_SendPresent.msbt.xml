	<message label="003">Between us two, <tag a="110" b="3" />,</message>
	<message label="004">So, <tag a="110" b="3" />, I was thinking...</message>
	<message label="005">What do you think, <tag a="110" b="3" />?</message>
	<message label="101">One of my favorite things to do is
to relax at home and sip a nice, hot
beverage. I thought I might send
something to help you do the same.
Now your home can feel like a café!
I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.</message>
	<message label="102">Even if you've already got a clock,
I thought you might like another.
I like to keep two clocks around,
myself. It gives me peace of mind,
since at least one is bound to keep
telling time even if the other stops.</message>
	<message label="103">I can't resist buying anything that
makes my home feel like a library.
The problem is that sometimes I'll
mess up and buy things I already
own. Would you be willing to take
this so I don't have to feel silly?</message>
	<message label="104">I saw something in the store that I
liked, but I thought it would look so
much better on you. I went ahead
and bought this because I want to
see if I'm right. If you do like it, I'd
love to have you model it for me.</message>
	<message label="105">I'm obsessed with cooking, so I'm
picky about what I keep around to
cook with. I recently did a bit of a
kitchen update, and wondered if
this was something you could use?
I hope you love it as much as I did.</message>
