	<message label="101">I'm sending you the gift that you
couldn't carry home from the party.
We had a hard time deciding what
we should get for you, so here's
hoping we chose well and you like
it. Best wishes for your next year!</message>
	<message label="102">Here's that gift that you weren't
able to carry home with you the
other day. Hope you like it! While
I've got your attention, can I sneak
in one last happy birthday wish?
It was great to celebrate with you!</message>
	<message label="103">Happy birthday, <tag a="110" b="3" />!
Here's that present you've been
waiting for, the one you couldn't
take home from the party. I know
I speak for everyone when I say
I hope you had a really great day!</message>
	<message label="104">What a fun birthday party! I wanted
to make sure your cupcakes got to
you as soon as possible, since you
weren't able to take them with you.
There are a lot, so you may want
to share them around with friends.</message>
	<message label="105">Did you have fun at your party?
I'm so glad I was there to celebrate
with you! I'm sending along those
birthday cupcakes from the piñata,
the ones you couldn't carry home.
Share them while they're fresh!</message>
	<message label="106">Wasn't that a great birthday party?
I'm sending along these cupcakes
now before I forget. I think they
came out pretty tasty—hope you
agree! I bet you'd make even more
friends if you shared these around.</message>
	<message label="107">Thanks for sharing one of your
cupcakes with me. I wanted to
make sure you got this present
that I couldn't give you before.
I said this already, but I hope
you had a very happy birthday!</message>
	<message label="108">It was a really nice gesture for you
to share one of your cupcakes with
me. I wanted to give you this gift
then, but you weren't able to carry
it home. I hope you like it, and that
you had a really great birthday!</message>
	<message label="109">Thank you so much for sharing one
of your cupcakes with me recently.
You couldn't take this gift home
with you at the time, but I wanted
to make sure you got something
from me for your birthday. Enjoy!</message>
