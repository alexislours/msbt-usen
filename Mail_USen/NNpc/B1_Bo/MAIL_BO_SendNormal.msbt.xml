	<message label="101">I had a dream that me and you
climbed a mountain! In the dark!
At the top was a couch. We sat and
ate snacks and watched the sun
come up. It was real chill and fun.</message>
	<message label="102">I've been itching to write you a
card ever since I woke up this
morning! Actually...I've been 
itching ever since I woke up

	<message label="106">Did you know that books are
just a buncha letters? And there's
only, um, I gotta count...
OK! There's only 104 letters.
How do they make such 
big books with that few letters?</message>
	<message label="107">Isn't this postcard pretty?
I don't want to cover it up with too
much of my writing, because I think
it is pretty and I should let you see
it. That is why I am only writing a
few words and then I am done.</message>
	<message label="108">I like writing letters because it
makes me think about how my
grandma wrote letters before
people quit writing letters.
Write a letter, <tag a="110" b="3" />!
Be like my grandma!</message>
	<message label="109">Do you like how this
postcard smells?
I dipped it in gravy,
then licked the gravy off
and sent it to you!</message>

What did the cake say
while cutting an onion?
