couldn't give ya!</message>
	<message label="102">Thanks for coming to visit the
other day! It was real nice to eat
snacks, chill out, and goof off a
bunch! Also, it's nice to have
someone else leave crumbs behind.
Here's that gift I couldn't give ya!</message>
	<message label="103">Thanks for hanging out the
other day! Did ya have fun?
I had tons of fun! You have the
best confused looks! Come over
and get confused again sometime.
I hope you like this gift!</message>
	<message label="104">Y'know how I was like, "I'll send
it to you!" when you were over?
Well, I remembered! Remembering
things feels funny. "Oh yeah" feels
like a pillow, but "I forgot" feels like
a stale chip.</message>
