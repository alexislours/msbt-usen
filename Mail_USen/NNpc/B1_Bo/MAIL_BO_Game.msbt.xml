	<message label="101">That game we played the
other day was so fun!
My heart pounded
real hard! Exciting!
Here's the fruit prize
I couldn't get to you!</message>

we played the other day! You
looked real smart when you were
playing! I'm still tingling! Let's play
again—it was so much fun!</message>
	<message label="103">Did you enjoy our game the other
day? Here are the fruits I couldn't
hand to you last time. I almost
snuck a bite because they looked
so good! I didn't. But I almost did.</message>
