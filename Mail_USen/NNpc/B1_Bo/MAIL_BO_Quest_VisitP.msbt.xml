	<message label="101">I had a buncha fun the
other day! Invite me over
again sometime. I'm real
curious about the
secret rooms I haven't
seen yet!</message>
	<message label="102">I had so much fun hanging out at
your place the other day! I promise
I won't tell nobody about the
secret room I found! I wanna
see what's inside next time!</message>
	<message label="103">Thanks for showing me
your place the other day.
If you ya wanna clean up
the stuff that was on
your floor, you should
use this thing!</message>
	<message label="104">Your house was so neat!
Next time I'm over, can ya
teach me how to use
that furniture that was
facing the wrong way?</message>
	<message label="105">It was cool seeing your house.
I thought maybe you could use this.
Furniture is kinda my thing.
That, and bugs.
And snacks.
A lotta things are my thing.</message>
	<message label="106">Your house was so nice!
I have this thing that I think
would look real neat with 
your things. I am giving it
to you so you can put it with
your things.</message>
	<message label="107">It's real fun hanging out at friend's
houses! You can pretend like ya
live there. And you can think, "Man,
there's way less hand prints on
these walls." OH! Here's a thing for
YOUR walls. It's not a hand print.</message>
	<message label="108">Your place has so much rare stuff,
it's like a museum!
I didn't touch anything!
(Blathers always says no touching.)
I hope I can come by again!
(I won't touch anything!)</message>
	<message label="109">You have so much expensive stuff
in your house! I was worried I'd
break things, so I tried to keep
track of my body all the time.
But I got you a present just in case
I forgot where my body was.</message>
	<message label="110">Thanks for having
me over the other day!
I had loads of fun.
Your place seemed a bit
empty, so take this!
I hope ya like it!</message>
	<message label="111">A huh huh, you're like me!
You don't like cleaning up either!
But ya gotta, I guess. That's what
my mom and dad always said!
Here! Maybe this will help ya!
I'm done not using it.</message>
	<message label="112">Thanks for the other day!
It was so cozy at your place that
I stayed for a real long time!
I'm sending you a thank-you gift.
I hope you like it!
Let's hang out again!</message>
