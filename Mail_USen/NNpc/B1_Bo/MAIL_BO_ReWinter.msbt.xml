	<message label="101">Man, I liked your card a bunch!
And the present was real neat!
I think they call it "heartwarming"?
But my heart is inside me, and it's
already warm in there, so I dunno!</message>
	<message label="102">Thanks for the great gift!
Presents sent in December
feel extra special,
don'tcha think?
I'm sending you a special
thing too!</message>
	<message label="103">Thank you for the card and the
present! I'm sending you a card
too! (This is it.) And a present!
(It's attached!)</message>
	<message label="104">I got your card while
I was cleaning the house!
I showed it to the bugs in the walls
and to the bugs in the floors and
then I forgot I was cleaning. We
were all so happy.</message>
	<message label="105">This has been a real good year,
huh, <tag a="110" b="3" />?

I'm glad I got to spend some
of it with you because you
are real neat.</message>
	<message label="106">I got your card, and then I decided
that I needed to send you a card,
so I went and bought cards, but I
couldn't find a pen, so I went and
bought a pen, and then I came
home and wrote this!</message>
