	<message label="101">I wanted to surprise you with a
thing, so I bought you a thing and
sent it to you because I wanted
you to have it! Now you have the
thing! I sent it to you! Enjoy it!
It's your thing now! Yay!</message>
	<message label="102">A huh, that's a joke! "Blockhead!"
Because "wooden block" furniture.
Ha! Thought of that, I dunno, three
days ago? Anyway, I saw this and
thought of you. And I also I wanted
to say the "blockhead" joke.</message>
	<message label="103">I bought this costume so I could
play pretend! Buuut the bugs in the
floor get freaked out every time I
put it on. You seem like the kinda
person that can play dress up
without scaring a buncha bugs.</message>
	<message label="104">I saw this when I was out shopping.
I thought it'd go on your body
because they made it with holes
for your body to fit through. I hope
that your body fits inside of it.
Do you like my surprise present?</message>
	<message label="105">But I have more than two shoes?
I don't need more than two shoes.
And the bugs say my extra shoes
smell too bad to live in. I know
you have two feet. Do you have
two shoes?</message>
