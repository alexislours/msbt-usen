you thought of me! I've been
shopping all the year-end sales,
so I got you something too!</message>

The year's almost over, so I got

the next one off right!</message>

I've always said, "Time flies when

	<message label="105">This year sure ended FAST! It was
only 300-and-something days long.
How am I supposed to get anything
done in that short of a time?! We'll
have to try and do more next year!</message>
	<message label="106">IT'S ALMOST OVER! GAAAAAH!
When I think about how it's the end
of the year, I kind of feel sort of
sad. But then I remember we can
hang out all next year, and I feel
better! Have a happy new year!</message>
