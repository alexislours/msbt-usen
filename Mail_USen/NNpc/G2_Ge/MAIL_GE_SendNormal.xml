	<message label="010">My special <tag a="110" b="3" />,</message>
	<message label="101">Once, my teacher caught me
passing a note and I had to read it
aloud. It said "I hate pop music."
I WAS LYING! I wanted to impress
this girl, Debbie. She liked prog
rock. WHAT EVEN IS PROG ROCK?</message>
	<message label="102">What're you up to? I know you're
always out there, you know, being
your best self...and stuff? But I
kind of worry you're working too
hard, <tag a="110" b="3" />. Sometimes
you've got to take a break!</message>
	<message label="103">Sometimes when I'm writing notes,
like this one, I, you know, FORGET
what I was writing and it just goes
nowhere for a while and the next
thing I know, I've sent it. Does that
ever happen to you?</message>
	<message label="104">I saw you in my dreams last night.
It was CRAYzeeeeeee! So tell me—
were you there on purpose? I
thought maybe you have something
important to tell me? Like why you
were a huge dancing beetle?</message>
	<message label="105">Yesterday I was thinking about
ways I could boost my pop-star
profile, but I couldn't come up
with anything. I mean...practicing
dancing, learning to sing, whatever.
None of it makes me famous NOW.</message>
	<message label="106">It's, you know, really (really) hard
sometimes to tell someone how
you feel. Face-to-face, I mean.
So I decided to put my feelings
in a letter. OK, here goes...
I'm happy you're my friend!</message>
	<message label="107">If I read in a car, I always end up
wanting to hork. ALWAYS. "Once
upon a time..." and there's my
lunch, right where it doesn't
belong. But chewing gum
does totally help!</message>
	<message label="108">I was shopping when I found...
GLITTER GLUE. I bought it so fast
because...GLITTER GLUE! Have you
ever impulse bought a thing? Then
wished you hadn't, because now
there's glitter glue everywhere?</message>
	<message label="109">It's always fun to chat with you.
You make me happy and I thought
I'd tell you so! In fact, spoiler alert,
a LOT of folks like you and care
about you and wish they could buy
an action figure of you. It's true.</message>
	<message label="110">I've kept every note I've gotten
from a friend. I totally have to
rent an off-island storage unit to
hold those notes... But they're
from friends, so it's worth the cost!</message>
