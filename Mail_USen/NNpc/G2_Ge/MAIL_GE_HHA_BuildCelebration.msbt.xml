	<message label="101">I hear your place has a new room,
<tag a="110" b="3" />! You should let
me come over and check your
interior design. I'm sending you a
little congrats prezzie—hope you
love it!</message>
	<message label="102">HIIIIIIII! Congrats on the new room!
Now that you've got new walls and
ceiling and floor, you need stuff to
decorate it all! So here's a prezzie.
It's for you! (I mean, that's obvs,
but it felt like the thing to say?)</message>
	<message label="103">I read in an old magazine called
Decorating Palaces on a Budget
that, when you have a bunch of
rooms, you need a bunch of stuff!
I'm sending you some furniture
so you can get your clutter on!</message>
	<message label="104">Your house is two stories? Wow!
That. Is. SO COOL! Hey, can I do
a concert on your roof? I promise
I won't fall off this time! While you
decide, here's a prezzie (not a
bribe) for you! Enjoy!</message>
