	<message label="101">Valentine's Day is a time to say the
stuff you're usually too shy to say.
I'm not too shy to say anything, so
I'll just say it louder. YOU'RE
SUPERDUPER SPECIAL TO ME! 
Eep! My cheeks are all red now!</message>
	<message label="102">Happy Valentine's Day! Thanks for
being the very best bestie. These
are the most special chocolates of
all time, and they're just for you.
Enjoy! </message>

Did you know today's all about
sending chocolate to your favorite
folks? Well, it is! That means you,
bestie. We'll be friends forever
(and ever and ever and ever).</message>
	<message label="104"> Happy Valentine's Day! 
I was thinking about who to send
this to, and then it hit me. Who am I
most grateful for? Who makes my
cheeks hurt from smiling? Whose
star is nearly as bright as my own?</message>
	<message label="105">You've been waiting for this treat,
haven't you? At long last, it has
arrived! This gift is sweet, and so
are you, so... Enjoy reveling in
that sweet sweetness! </message>
	<message label="106">This chocolate is special because
it's filled with love from me to you.
Don't worry, you can totes still eat
it! Thanks for being a good friend
and my most devoted fan.</message>
	<message label="107">Happy Valentine's Day! 
Our friendship is like my stardom...
always rising higher and shining
brighter! This chocolate is a tasty,
melty symbol of that (but hopefully
our friendship lasts longer).</message>
	<message label="108">Happy Valentine's Day!  I feel like
we've got a good thing going, you
and I. You know what else is good?
YUMMY CHOCOLATE. So here's
some of that, straight from my
heart to your tummy.</message>
	<message label="109">It's Valentine's Day! You don't have
to say a thing. I know you've been
waiting for a gift from yours truly.
This is full of warmth and affection
and, most especially, chocolate.
Thanks for your undying support!</message>
