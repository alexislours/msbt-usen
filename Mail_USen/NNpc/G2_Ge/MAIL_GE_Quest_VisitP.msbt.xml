	<message label="101">Thanks for inviting me over! I feel
like I got to see a...secret...side
of you! Oh, right! I got inspired by
your...secret...side. And I bought
you a secret thing. It's attached!</message>
	<message label="102">Your place is cool! I'm still SUPER
interested in that secret room!
WHAT'S IN THERE?! Ah well,
everyone has their secrets.
Here's my thanks for the tour!
(It's a secret to everybody, OK?)</message>
	<message label="103">I had a lot of fun checking out your
house! Visiting a friend's place is
a solid way to get interior design
ideas.</message>
	<message label="104">I wrote you a poem:
"Thanks for inviting me over.
Your whole layout was very...you.
Was that furniture backwards?
Or is mine facing the wrong way?"</message>
	<message label="105">I enjoyed seeing your house
the other day! But...you didn't
have ANY furniture you'd need for,
you know, daily life? So I decided
to get you some! I hope you like it!</message>
	<message label="106">Thanks for showing me your place!
It was SO cozy and, you know, full
of things you need for daily life. Is
that weird to say? "Daily life." It
feels weird. "Daily life." Who SAYS
that? Anyhoo, I got you a thing.</message>
	<message label="107">Thank you for showing me your
interior-design skills! By the way,
did you end up putting something
(anything?!) on the walls after I
left? Well, just in case, I got you
something to hang up! Enjoy!</message>
	<message label="108">You've got SO MANY rare items in
your place! It was exciting to see
them all! I've got to learn to hunt
treasure! Here's a prezzie to say
thanks for the tour. I thought you'd
"dig" it! Get it? Dig? Treasure?</message>
	<message label="109">Thanks so much for the tour of
your place the other day! I was so
nervous because of all the REALLY
expensive furniture! It's not much,
but I got you something to say
thanks for the tour!</message>
	<message label="110">Thanks for having me over the
other day! I know you're not the
type that has a lot of things? But I
decided to get you some furniture
anyway! I think you'll like it!</message>
	<message label="111">I had fun at your house the other
day! There were so many THINGS
to look at! It was all very, very...
impressive! I got you a gift! I hope
I managed to hit your style.</message>
	<message label="112">Thanks for the tour the other
day! After I left your place, I did a
little furniture hunting for you, and
I thiiiiink this will give your room a
little extra sizzle! Or pizzazz. Or
awesomenessosity. One of those.</message>
