	<message label="101">You sent a prezzie in a letter. That
is totes classy, and cool, and wild.
I just HAD to try shoving something
big inside an envelope too! And it
worked! Like the guy on TV said,
"Physics is cray!"</message>
	<message label="102">Thanks for the message! AND the
prezzie! It was so simple and
sweet! I was, you know, kind of,
um, moved? Oh! I got you a
prezzie too! I hope you like it.</message>
	<message label="103">Your message? So cool. I don't
know how you can fit THAT MUCH
emotion in such a short letter!
I decided to be like you and attach
a prezzie to my message.
Did it get to you OK?</message>
	<message label="104">I LOOOOVE getting messages from
my friends! I get all excited even
when it's just someone saying
hi. I wanted to make you happy
too, so I totes replied to your
message A-SAP as possible!</message>
	<message label="105">Thanks SO much for the note!
It's so cool you can say so much
in, like, you know, not very many
words. I tried hard to make this
one short and cool like yours,
but here I am already on line six...</message>
	<message label="106">It kind of feels like writing short
messages is going to be the new
THING! It's pretty cool, right?
Yeah! I wanted to try it, but I can't
keep it all brief like you. I use too
many words instead of just keepi</message>
