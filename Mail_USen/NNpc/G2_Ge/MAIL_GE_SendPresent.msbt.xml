	<message label="005">You like furniture, <tag a="110" b="3" />?</message>
	<message label="006">Try this, <tag a="110" b="3" />!</message>

	<message label="009">My dear <tag a="110" b="3" />,</message>
	<message label="010">Eeek! <tag a="50" b="3" /><tag a="110" b="3" />!</message>
	<message label="101">So, I totes ordered WAAAAY too
many flower thingies because, you
know, "more is better." And I guess
sometimes it is. But not right now.
Because I can't walk in my house
with all the gardening stuff!</message>
	<message label="102">The umbrella I THOUGHT I lost?
Totes in my house ALL OF A
SUDDEN. Like, it must've ran off
and partied while I went and
bought a new one, then showed
back up! Now I'm giving it to you!</message>
	<message label="103">Ohmigosh! Check. This. OUTFIT!
I saw it and thought, "That would
look FAB on <tag a="110" b="3" />!"
So I bought it for you. Because
everyone should have a fashion
consultant!</message>
	<message label="104">Sometimes, if I'm feeling lonely or
scared of vampires...I'll sleep with
a stuffed toy! So, if you ever freak
out about floor vampires, grab a
fluffy buddy and sleep tight!</message>
	<message label="105">OHMIGOSH! I bought this furniture
because it was totally glam...then I
realized I had no room for it.
You want it?</message>
	<message label="106">I believe it's super important to be
adventurous in fashion, so I got
you this piece because it looks like
something you'd never wear. Since
I can't see your reaction in person,
I'll just assume you love it.</message>
	<message label="107">Know what I love about glasses?
How much they change your face!
Wait! That came out wrong. I just
think it would be cool if you looked
like a totally different person.
What I mean is...I give up.</message>
	<message label="108">Every outfit needs a centerpiece—
a little pop of color that pulls the
whole thing together. Accessories
really are the workhorses of the
fashion world. Well, accessories
and buttons.</message>
	<message label="109">So I've been thinking, and we
should be hanging out way more.
Maybe sending you surprise gifts
isn't the most efficient way to tell
you that, but what can I say? You
deserve extra special treatment.</message>
	<message label="110">This is one of my favorite tops of
ALL TIME! It's bold, it's colorful...
it's fashion gold! Just imagining
you in it has me squeaking with
delight. So much so, I gave myself
a headache, <tag a="110" b="3" />!</message>
