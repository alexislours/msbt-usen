	<message label="101">So, I totes ordered WAAAAY too
many flower thingies because, you
know, "more is better." And I guess
sometimes it is. But not right now.
Because I can't walk in my house
with all the gardening stuff!</message>
	<message label="102">The umbrella I THOUGHT I lost?
Totes in my house ALL OF THE
SUDDEN. Like, it must've ran off
and partied while I went and
bought a new one, then showed
back up! Now I'm giving it to you!</message>
	<message label="103">Ohmigosh! Check. This. OUTFIT!
I saw it and thought, "That would
look FAB on <tag a="110" b="3" />!"
So I bought it for you. Because
everyone should have a fashion
consultant!</message>
	<message label="104">Sometimes, if I'm feeling lonely or
scared of vampires...I'll sleep with
a stuffed toy! So, if you ever freak
out about floor vampires, grab a
fluffy buddy and sleep tight!</message>
	<message label="105">OHMIGOSH! I bought this furniture
because it was totally glam...then I
realized I had no room for it.
You want it?</message>
