	<message label="Msg_BO_01">It's real neat that your birthday 
happens every year. It happened
THIS year, and it'll happen next
year, and the year after that, and
the year after that... Man. I gotta
put all this on my calendar.</message>
	<message label="Msg_BO_02">Hearing "Happy birthday!" a bunch
on your birthday is good luck.

	<message label="Msg_BO_03">When it's birthday time that means
it's cake time. And cake time is
when I smush my face in the cake
and eat it all as fast as I can. I get
yelled at, but I can't hear it 'cause
of all the icing in my ears. Win-win.</message>
	<message label="Msg_HA_01">Happy birthday! I gotta tell you,
whenever I see your ultra delts and
mega biceps, I get SUPER pumped
to up my game. My giant muscles
wouldn't be what they are without 
you to inspire them. Thanks!</message>
	<message label="Msg_HA_02">Happy birthday! Meeting you totally
changed my life. My muscles got
bigger, my lap times got shorter, my
bench weight heavier... What I'm
saying is, you're the best. Now 
have yourself a birthday FLEX!</message>
	<message label="Msg_HA_03">Happy birthday! Did your muscles
get...musclier this year? 'Cause
seriously, I am in awe. And I can't
wait to see what the next year's
got in store. This flex is for you...
OK, I just flexed and it was great.</message>
	<message label="Msg_KO_01">Surprised to be gettin' a message
from me? Dunno why you would be.
This is your big day, and there's no
better time for your pals to check
in and tell you how great you are!
Here's to you, <tag a="110" b="3" />!</message>
	<message label="Msg_KO_02">Havin' a good day? Must feel neat
knowin' there's a concert bein' put
on in your honor today! In case you
didn't know it already, folks around
here care about you and are glad
you're here on our island with us.</message>
	<message label="Msg_KO_03">I should be tellin' you this to your
face instead of writin', but I just
gotta say I'm proud to be your pal.
I sure am glad we have a day just
for celebratin' you, 'cause you're
the best and you deserve the best.</message>
	<message label="Msg_ZK_01">I'm so excited to celebrate your
birthday this year that it almost
feels like it's MY birthday! Don't
worry—I'm not expecting any gifts.
Seriously, though...have the best
birthday ever, <tag a="110" b="3" />!</message>
	<message label="Msg_ZK_02">Happy Birthday! Another year
older, another year awesomer.
Getting to know you has been
super fun, and I can't wait for
another year of it! I hope you do
something extra special today.</message>
	<message label="Msg_ZK_03">Congratulations on completing
another trip around that giant
fireball in the sky! I'm so grateful
for all the memories we've made
together, <tag a="110" b="3" />...
Please excuse the tear stains.</message>
	<message label="Msg_FU_01">Here's hoping your birthday is full

cheers me up, and that you make
life here better for everyone!</message>
	<message label="Msg_FU_02">Happy birthday to you with all my
heart! I hope you know how much
you mean to everyone here. You've
been like a gift to our community,
and you bring so much joy into our
lives every day, just by being you! </message>
	<message label="Msg_FU_03">Happy birthday! I'm so glad you're
in my life so we can share good
times on this island together.
I hope it's been just as fun for you.
My wish for you is that your coming
year is full of laughs and smiles.</message>
	<message label="Msg_GE_01">This year it's K.K. serenading you
on your birthday. Someday he'll be
my opening act when I serenade 
you on your birthday. I'm so happy
you're looking forward to it as
much as I am!</message>
	<message label="Msg_GE_02">Do something crazy, like skydiving!
I did that on my b-day one year.
Took a class, suited up, and jumped
out of a plane! I have no idea what
I was thinking! I screamed all the
way down and an hour after that!</message>
	<message label="Msg_GE_03">You're not just my BFF, you're my
CBHBFFAEY too! That means,
"My Coolest Birthday-Having Best
Friend Forever and Ever, YAY!"
You're the only CBHBFFAEY that
I have, so I'm pretty lucky!</message>
	<message label="Msg_OT_01">I confess, I am full of emotions on
your birthday. It's just... I'm so
very grateful for you! You are
fabulous beyond words, and I wish
you every happiness in the world.</message>
	<message label="Msg_OT_02">Happiest of birthdays! Please know
that I am going to work hard to
make this another wonderful year
for you. I do hope you'll continue
to grace me with your friendship.
It means the world to me!</message>
	<message label="Msg_OT_03">Happy birthday! It has been such
a delight watching you be the very
best you this past year. Keep up
the good work! May our friendship
continue to grow so I can wish you
a happy birthday year after year!</message>
	<message label="Msg_AN_01">Happy birthday! How you feelin'?
Stronger? More agile? Maybe a
bit wiser? Well, guess what—you're
all of the above! So here's to great
stats, and another year of you
bein' your fearless self. Go you!</message>
	<message label="Msg_AN_02">OK, this is kinda embarrassin' to
say, but every day I get even more
stoked to be on this island with
you. So happy birthday, and thanks
for being you. <tag a="50" b="3" /><tag a="110" b="9" />
wouldn't be the same without you.</message>
	<message label="Msg_AN_03">I hope this day finds you well on 
your joyous birthday... No, I can't
do all this fancy-talk stuff. So yeah,
HAPPY B-DAY! Thanks for bein' my
pal. It means a lot. I can't wait to
see the mischief we get into next!</message>
	<message label="Msg_sza">Just wanted to say Happy Birthday!
I hope the year is full of wonderful
things for you, <tag a="110" b="1" />. I
may need to lean on you from time
to time, but I hope we'll be friends
for all the years to come!</message>

	<message label="Msg_rcm">Happy Birthday! You're always
helping us in so many ways. I hope
you'll continue to shop at Nook's
Cranny and stop in to say hi to me
and my brother every so often.
We'll be waiting!</message>
	<message label="Msg_rct">Happy Birthday! Did you know that
every day my brother and I look
forward to seeing you in the shop?
You always seem so busy to me,
but I hope you remember to take
a break every now and then.</message>
	<message label="Msg_owl">A little bird told me that today is

I hope the day brings you the same
joy you so often bring to others.</message>

stiff. I wanted to wish you a very
happy birthday. I hope you find the
time to reflect on the year you've
just finished and what lies ahead.</message>
