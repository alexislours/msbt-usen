	<message label="101">Thank you so much for allowing me
to upload your dream earlier. It is a
truly sweet dream, and so I have
arranged what I hope is a truly
sweet gift for you.</message>
	<message label="102">I am certain many memories of your
island are dear to you. What if you
could share those memories in the
form of a pleasant dream? You can,
and it is as easy as falling asleep in
your bed...</message>
	<message label="103">I am so glad we met the other day.
Please know that whenever you
wish to share a treasured memory
of your island, or should you want
to dream another's dream, you
need only fall asleep in your bed.</message>
