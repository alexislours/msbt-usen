	<message label="101">We've completed the expansion of
your lovely home. However, during
construction, we had to place one
or more wall-hanging items in your
storage. Hope you understand.</message>
	<message label="102">I appreciate how you've helped
prepare homes for new island
residents. As a thank-you gift, I've
included some fencing for your
home. Good fences make good
neighbors, after all!</message>
	<message label="103">A new resident moved to a plot you
set up! As a small token of our
appreciation, we've put 1,000 Nook
Miles into your account. We hope
you spend them on something that
makes you happy.</message>
	<message label="104">Oh my! I'm feeling the music! So
glad you came to K.K.'s concert.
His memorable song Welcome
Horizons is my gift to you. Pop
it into an item that can play music,
and enjoy it whenever you like!</message>
	<message label="105">To celebrate the opening of the
new Resident Services building, we
have lots of new miles-redemption
items available. Plus, we now have
a new service for Nook Miles+
members to earn 5x more miles!</message>
	<message label="106">I'm writing to advise you of some
special Nook Miles+ activities that
are available from now until May
4th. All part of our Nature Day
event! Yes, yes! I do hope you'll
come see me for more details, hm?</message>
	<message label="107">I would like nothing more than to
give you this gift in person, but
with Resident Services under
construction, I've decided to leave
your May Day Ticket with Orville.
I hope you enjoy your excursion!</message>
