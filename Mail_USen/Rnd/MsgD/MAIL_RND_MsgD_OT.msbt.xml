	<message label="004">Dearest whoever you are,</message>
	<message label="005">My dear anonymous reader, </message>
	<message label="101">Whilst taking a much-needed hot
bath, my mind dreamed up the most
fabulous idea for a DIY recipe.</message>
	<message label="102">I was on an aimless stroll when an
idea for the most wonderful DIY
recipe came to me on the breeze.</message>
	<message label="103">I can NOT stop thinking about this
furniture I saw in a dream! So,
I have turned it into a DIY recipe.</message>
	<message label="104">I've grown weary of run-of-the-mill
furniture. So, I have designed a DIY
furniture recipe sure to inspire!</message>
	<message label="105">Would you believeâ€”an amazing DIY
recipe simply popped into my mind
as I was enjoying a cup of tea!</message>
	<message label="201">Of course, I believe great ideas
such as mine MUST be shared.</message>
	<message label="202">Now I find myself compelled to
share this recipe with others.</message>
	<message label="203">It would be cruel of me to keep this
recipe to myself, so I am sharing.</message>
	<message label="204">I am compelled to share my recipe,
so I have stuffed it in this bottle.</message>
	<message label="205">I cannot keep this idea to myself.
So I have placed it in this bottle.</message>
	<message label="301">May it inspire you to action.</message>
	<message label="302">Please. Bring this recipe to life.</message>
	<message label="303">Try making it. You will not be sorry.</message>
	<message label="304">Do please consider making it!</message>
	<message label="305">It would please me if you made it.</message>
	<message label="401">Best wishes, <tag a="110" b="10" /></message>
	<message label="402">With hopes, <tag a="110" b="10" /></message>
	<message label="403">Your muse, <tag a="110" b="10" /></message>
	<message label="404">Sincerely, <tag a="110" b="10" /></message>
	<message label="405">Faraway wishes, <tag a="110" b="10" /> </message>
	<message label="501">Are you paying proper attention to
your appearance, darling? A mirror
can help you put yourself together.
I've included a DIY mirror recipe
in this bottle. Do make one for
yourself when the mood strikes.</message>
