	<message label="101">So I was strollin' along the beach,
listening to the waves roll in, when
suddenly I had this rad DIY idea.</message>
	<message label="102">It turns out great DIY ideas can hit
at really inconvenient times. Like
juuuuust as I'm falling asleep.</message>
	<message label="103">I was out gardening, elbow deep in
dirt and face bumping my flowers,
when I got this way-cool DIY idea.</message>
	<message label="104">I was reading a letter I got from my
dad back home, and something he
wrote gave me a solid DIY idea.</message>
	<message label="105">I was out doing... whatever I like to
do (none of your business and who
cares?) and got this cool DIY idea.</message>
	<message label="201">I was gonna keep it to myself, but
it's so good I just had to share.</message>
	<message label="202">Then I had a crazy idea for sharing
that recipe, and here we are.</message>
	<message label="203">I wrote the recipe down as quick as
I could in case I forgot it.</message>
	<message label="204">And then I thought, where's the fun
in keeping the recipe to myself.</message>
	<message label="205">I figured SOMEBODY out there
would wanna try building it.</message>
	<message label="301">Well, from here it's all you!</message>
	<message label="302">So get to it! Build build build!</message>
	<message label="303">And with that... Good luck!</message>
	<message label="304">You've got this. I believe in you!</message>
	<message label="305">I promise it might not explode.</message>

	<message label="501">I came up with a rockin' recipe for
a DIY mirror a bit ago and thought
you'd wanna check it out. It's easy
to make, plus you can check out
your hair or whatever with it. Give
it a whirl and see what you think!</message>
