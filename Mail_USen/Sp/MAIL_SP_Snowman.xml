for making me...me! Now you're a
step closer to being as cool and
cracklin' as I am! How chill is that?
Thanks again!</message>
	<message label="102">Thanks for making me look so cool!
I'll give you this item to say thanks,
and I'm hoping it'll make you as
chill and ice-cool as me!</message>
	<message label="103">I'm really happy I met you this
winter! I'll give you this frosty-cool
item as a thank-you for exercising
your pro-level, snow-rolling skills.
I hope you're the one who makes
me next time too!</message>
	<message label="104">You really gotta let me thank you!
Sure, I'll melt away someday, but
this is a special item for a special
time, and it won't blink in the heat
of summer. You can hold onto it for
a very long time!</message>
	<message label="105">I've got nothing but gratitude for
you, friend. You made me so well,
I'm dripping with coolness. I'm so
cool, I feel like my chill memory
will stick around even after I've
melted away.</message>
	<message label="106">As a special treat for making me,
I'm gonna teach you how to make
one cool item! But if you've never
done a DIY project before, you
should take the DIY workshop held
in Resident Services.</message>
