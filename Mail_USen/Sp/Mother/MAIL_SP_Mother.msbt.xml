	<message label="101_01">As I greet the New Year,
I've decided to become one of
those fancy "hobby" people.

If my creativity were a flower,
it would be in full bloom.</message>
	<message label="102_01">I blow onto my icy hands to
warm them... It doesn't work,
but it's something to do.

If I stitch fast enough, maybe I'll
be able to feel my fingers again.</message>
	<message label="103_01">Like a cheap candle, the snow is
melting fast, replaced by lovely
flowers and plants.

Spring sure knows how to make
an entrance.</message>
	<message label="104_01">Cherry-blossom petals dance upon
the wind, like some kind of bizarre
battalion of breeze ballerinas.

A smile graces my face as I watch
the petals fall. All is well until...</message>
	<message label="105_01">The smell of trees and freshly cut
grass brings out the adventurer in
me. Wandering season is upon us!

I'm not sure which I like better,
wandering or meandering...</message>
	<message label="106_01">Fireflies light up the night sky,
taking my mind off the stresses
of the day.

As I watch, amazed and distracted,
the mosquitoes make their move.</message>
	<message label="107_01">The cicadas cry into the morning
light, awakening the world with
their cacophonous symphony.

Your mother cries out as well,
lamenting her lack of sleep.</message>
	<message label="108_01">When I see a falling star, I close
my eyes and wish for... Nice try,
darling! It's a secret, of course.

Here's to making wishes and
chasing dreams.</message>
	<message label="109_01">Ah, that brief time of year when
nature is too indecisive to be
either too hot or too cold.

If only my own indecisiveness was
this enjoyable!</message>
	<message label="110_01">With apple-stuffed cheeks, I take
long walks and read long books.
I take long naps in long pajamas.

This time of year is wonderful,
but far too short.</message>
	<message label="111_01">Something about seeing piles of
colorful leaves everywhere puts
me in the mood to bake.

Pies! Cakes! Muffins! Biscuits!
I can't fight this. I won't.</message>
	<message label="112_01">The house is covered in snow,
like a thick blanket. One that's
cold and wet...

As I battle the bitter cold, I think
of you and sew through the night.</message>

	<message label="151_01">Whenever I see a plane, I think of
you and wave at those airborne
strangers with all my might.

I had no idea how many flights took
off each day. My arm is exhausted.</message>
	<message label="151_02">How is your new life treating you?
Are you eating well? Brushing your
teeth? Washing behind your ears?

Oh dear, I'm all worked up... Here's
a little something to help out.</message>
	<message label="152_01">Today you're one year older and
one year wiser. Maybe it's time to
give broccoli another go?

No matter what, you'll always be
my baby.</message>
	<message label="152_02">Do you remember when we first
met? Of course not, silly. But it
was on this very day.

If that's not cause to celebrate,
I don't know what is.</message>
