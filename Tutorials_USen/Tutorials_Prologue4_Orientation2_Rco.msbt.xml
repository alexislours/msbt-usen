so please feel free to set up your

<anim id="Oops" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Oh! <delay20 />Except for this plaza area,
of course. <delay20 /><anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />We'll need a communal
spot like this, hm?</message>
	<message label="002_02" attrib="00 00 00"><anim id="QuestionMark" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Are you worried about finding just
the right spot? <10_4 /><anim id="Negative" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Don't be!<pageBreak /><anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />For now, choose a spot that speaks
to you. <delay20 />Trust your instincts!<delay20 /> <anim id="Grin" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It has
always worked for me. <delay20 />Yes, yes!
<anim id="Serious" target="actor" targetSpec="" />And, down the road, if you feel
you've made a mistake, we can
talk about relocating, hm?</message>

island as you are, so I can't offer
any recommendations quite yet.
<anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />And I do have one more small favor
to ask<tag a="110" b="0" /><pageBreak /><anim id="Serious" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Please don't pick up anything from
the ground. <delay20 />And please don't shake
the trees either. <delay20 />No, no!
<anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />The proper waivers must be signed
first, hm?</message>

<delay20 /><anim id="QuestionMark" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Can you wait here while we check

our guests, <tag a="115" b="1" arg="0xcd00" /> and

Once they've set up their tents,
bring them back here, yes, yes.</message>

	<message label="005" attrib="00 00 00"><anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Of course, of course. Take your time.
There's no need to feel rushed by the
clock on an uninhabited island.
Just let me know when you're all set.</message>

	<message label="012" attrib="00 00 00"><anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />You're the first one back, so I
suppose the others must still be
searching for just the right location.
<anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />You know<tag a="110" b="0" />since you've already done
some scouting, the others may
appreciate your assistance. <delay20 /><anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Yes, yes!</message>
