Mother's Day is a day for saying
"thank you" to that warm, loving

you. What should go into a gift mug?
How about all your love, for starters?</message>

Father's Day is when we say, "Thanks
for watching out for me, Dad!" But

Celebrated on July 7th, this is the
one day that the deities Orihime and
Hikoboshi—represented by the stars
Vega and Altair—can meet. Write a
wish on tanzaku paper, hang it from
bamboo, and wish on the stars!</message>

In Japan, many celebrate the new
year with toshikoshi-soba ("year-
passing soba") for good luck. The
noodles' length is a symbol of long
life, and the ease of cutting them
represents cutting away misfortunes.</message>

A Berliner Pfannkuchen is a type of
German pastry filled with jam and
topped with sugar—not unlike a jelly
donut. They're available year-round,
but are a traditional treat in Germany
for New Year's celebrations.</message>

You eat las doce uvas de la suerte
("the 12 grapes of luck") at midnight
on New Year's Eve for good fortune.
As the bell tolls 12, you eat one
grape for each ring. That's not a lot
of time to eat 12 grapes!</message>

No party to celebrate the new year is
complete without everybody raising
a glass of sparkling cider together.
Reflect on the past year and wish
everyone a good year to come...
Cheers!</message>

Japanese tradition has it that
Toshigami-sama, a god of the new
year, visits each house on the first of
the year to bless it. The kadomatsu is
like a signpost to welcome him in.</message>

This salad, a staple of New Year's
celebrations in Russia, came about
at the end of the 19th century. It was
invented by Lucien Olivier, but since
his recipe wasn't publicized, nobody
knows the "official" way to make it.</message>

Yut Nori is a traditional Korean
board game. Instead of dice, it is
played with wooden sticks called
"yuts." Play it with family on New
Year's, but don't get so into it that
you have the first fight of the year!</message>
