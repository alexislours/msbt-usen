brushwork of Fūjin and Raijin on
a gold-leaf background.
It is thought to be the masterpiece of
Tawaraya Sōtatsu, an early-Edo-
period artist.
The simplification of the subjects is
a style that was carried on by
Ogata Kōrin.
It's a style still in use today in the
Rinpa school of Japanese painting.</message>
