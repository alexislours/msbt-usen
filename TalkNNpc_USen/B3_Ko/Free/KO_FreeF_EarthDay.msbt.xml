<anim id="Negative" target="actor" targetSpec="" />aren't sold in normal stores?
<anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Yeah, sometimes that fella seems

flower bed<tag a="110" b="0" /><pageBreak />But one look at all that rare stuff
he's sellin',<delay20 /><anim id="Grin" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> and ya know he's usin'
the premium mulch.</message>

normal ol' trees,<delay8 /> won't wither if you

No sirree!<delay20 /><anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> They grow up real nice
side by side.<pageBreak />Weird as it sounds,<delay8 /><anim id="Grin" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> you might say
they actually like each other's

flowers and trees and whatnot?<delay frames="40" />
<anim id="Angry" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Not good, <delay8 />that's how it'd be!

Then one day, <anim id="Shocked" target="actor" targetSpec="" />a color I'd never seen
before bloomed right there in the

<anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I tell ya,<delay8 /> just when you think you've
got Mother Nature figured out, she
throws something crazy at ya.
<anim id="Greeting" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Like funny flowers<tag a="110" b="0" />or man-faced
stink bugs. <delay20 /><anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Ever seen one of them?<delay20 />
<anim id="Serious" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It's a BUG with a FACE on its back!
<anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Like I said,<delay8 /> nature is nuts.<delay frames="40" /> <anim id="Laughing" target="actor" targetSpec="" />But it
