manners, <tag a="110" b="6" /><tag a="110" b="0" /><pageBreak /><anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I had this dream that someone came
to visit me, and they were the spittin'
image of you.<delay20 /> It's uncanny!<pageBreak /><anim id="Serious" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Hmm, what came next<tag a="110" b="0" /><delay8 /> <anim id="IdeaBulb" target="actor" targetSpec="" /><delay20 />Oh! <delay8 />I was
surprised and said, <delay8 />"Whoa! <delay8 />It's you!"<delay20 />
And then I told you about this dream.</message>

dreams will come true, but it'll sure
improve the odds.<pageBreak /><anim id="ShyBoy" target="actor" targetSpec="" />And even if nothing comes of it,<delay8 />
keep dreamin' those dreams, and
you'll end up somewhere swell.<pageBreak /><anim id="Blushing" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Wow! I sure sound smart for a dream

Easy.<delay20 /> Homemade <tag a="135" b="7" arg="0xcd00" />?<delay8 />
Even easier, kiddo!<pageBreak /><anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />The only downside—and it's quite a

sit a spell, kiddo?<pageBreak /><anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />My place probably ain't the most
