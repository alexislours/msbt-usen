myself think over this noise.<delay20 /> <anim id="Blushing" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Unless
I'm thinkin' of fireworks, that is.</message>

big secret off your chest, try yellin' it
out just as a firework goes off.<pageBreak /><anim id="ShyBoy" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Even if nobody else hears you over
the noise, <delay8 />it's still good practice for
if you ever wanna say it for real.</message>

fancy camera of some type,<delay20 /> <anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />so maybe
