<anim id="Negative" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Even I couldn't tear my eyes away!
So, like, I was planning to use
fireworks in my debut concert.<delay20 /><anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />

all lit up again like that next year!<pageBreak /><anim id="Aha" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Maybe it'll be even MORE lit up!<delay20 />
If it is, <delay8 /><anim id="Grin" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I'll probably explode along
