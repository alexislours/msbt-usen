believe this, <delay20 /><anim id="Serious" target="actor" targetSpec="" />but I was focusing

patterns everywhere! <delay frames="40" /><anim id="Shocked" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Even when
they weren't there!
<anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I guess when that happens <delay8 />it's called
the "egg effect" or something.<pageBreak />Anyhoo, I decided it was time to
take a little break.<delay8 /><anim id="FaintSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> You know, <delay8 />just
chill at home, relax, do some yoga.
<anim id="Worried" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Maybe you should take a little break
too, <tag a="110" b="3" />.<pageBreak />Take it from me, <anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />you do NOT want to

Did you know <colour id="3" />Zipper<colour id="65535" />'s over at the
plaza today?<delay frames="40" /> <anim id="HappyFlower" target="actor" targetSpec="" />So exciting, right?
<anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />OK,<delay8 /> I'll be honest,<delay8 /> <anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />he's a little<tag a="110" b="0" /><delay20 />how
do I put this<tag a="110" b="0" /><delay frames="40" /><anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />unusual.<delay20 /> No, wait,<delay20 /> <anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />let's
call him unique! That's it, unique!
<anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />He's suuuuper bouncy and, <delay8 />wow,<delay8 /> talk
about high energy!<pageBreak /><size value="75" /><anim id="ShyBoy" target="actor" targetSpec="" />And, sure, maybe he gets kinda skittish when
you walk up behind him.<size value="100" /><pageBreak /><anim id="HappyFlower" target="actor" targetSpec="" />But our big yellow buddy does,
like, soooo much work to make
Bunny Day nice for all of us!
I'll admit it, <anim id="Love" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I'm totes a big fan. He's
super fab in my book, <tag a="110" b="6" />.</message>

I should write an epic pop song to
celebrate it.<pageBreak /><anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I mean, <delay8 />ALL the best holidays have
their own songs, right?<delay20 /><anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> Why not
Bunny Day?
<anim id="HappyDance" target="actor" targetSpec="" />And ohmigosh! It could be THE hit
song that launches me to pop
stardom!
<anim id="FaintSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It's going to be a breeze to write
too.<delay frames="40" /> Like, <anim id="Clapping" target="actor" targetSpec="" />sooo many words rhyme
with bunny!

weird intel that I promised to keep
to myself, but<tag a="110" b="0" />
<anim id="Confused" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I can't do it.<delay20 /> I'm totes going to
explode if I don't tell someone.<delay20 />
<anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />And that someone is YOU!
Here goes<tag a="110" b="0" /><anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> <colour id="3" />Wilbur <colour id="65535" />says a certain
someone used a <colour id="1" /><tag a="50" b="0" arg="0x100 0xcd03" />Nook Miles Ticket
<colour id="65535" />to go on an island tour<tag a="110" b="0" />
<anim id="Greeting" target="actor" targetSpec="" />And while they were there, <delay8 />they hit
a rock<tag a="110" b="0" /><delay20 /><anim id="Shocked" target="actor" targetSpec="" />and that's when an egg
popped out.<delay8 /> Of the ROCK!
<anim id="Silent" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Totes weird, <delay8 />right? <delay frames="40" /><anim id="Confused" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Even weirder<tag a="110" b="0" />
I hear eggs are sometimes popping
out of rocks on THIS island too!
<anim id="ShyBoy" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I'd go check it out myself, but I've
got some vocal warm-ups to do.<pageBreak /><anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />But you should def go see if this
whole getting-eggs-from-rocks thing
is for real.
<anim id="Serious" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Let me know what you find out.<delay20 />

Bunny Day so much? <delay frames="40" /><anim id="Clapping" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It's because
the WEIRDEST stuff happens!
Like,<anim id="Greeting" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> if you stand next to a coconut
tree and give it a good smack,<delay20 /><anim id="Pardon" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> a
load of <tag a="50" b="0" arg="0x400 0xcd03" />wood eggs falls out!
Candy eggs growing on trees.<delay20 /> <anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />That's

They say if you go after medium fish
