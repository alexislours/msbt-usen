star surrounded by gobs of stylish
art and other cool cultural stuff.
Are you, like,<delay8 /><anim id="Aha" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> thinking what I'm
thinking?!<pageBreak /><anim id="HappyDance" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I'm thinking someone should totes
take my pic<delay20 /> and put it on the cover
of my fave new magazine<tag a="110" b="0" />
<anim id="SmugFace" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It's called The Sophisticated
<capitaliseNextWord /><tag a="110" b="15" /> and it is sooo me,

really tasteful never go out of style<tag a="110" b="0" />
not even when they're totes old.
<anim id="Greeting" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Take all the art and cultural stuff
around this place, for example.<delay20 />
<anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />They say it's "timeless."
<anim id="Serious" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Well, <delay8 />that's how I want to be too<tag a="110" b="0" /><delay20 />
Super hip and stylish <delay8 /><anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />for ALL

<anim id="HappyFlower" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Like, it is seriously one of my favorite
things to do.
<anim id="Serious" target="actor" targetSpec="" />But you know what I don't like? <delay frames="40" /><anim id="Angry" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I
don't like when someone tries to tell
me exactly what a piece of art means.
<anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />All that really matters is what it
means to ME, right?<pageBreak />And what it means to me <delay8 /><anim id="SmugFace" target="actor" targetSpec="" />is
always way cooler than the "real"
meaning anyway, <tag a="110" b="6" />.</message>

exhibit opening at the <colour id="1" />museum<colour id="65535" />,
I rushed right over!
<anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />As a pop-music artist myself, I think
it's important for me to show support
for ALL the art in <tag a="110" b="8" />.
<anim id="ShyBoy" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Also,<delay8 /> I think being seen in an art
museum is really good for my image.<delay frames="40" />
<anim id="BigSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Tell everyone you saw me here, 'K?</message>

heard the <colour id="1" />museum<colour id="65535" /> was opening
an art exhibit!
<anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Fashion is also a kind of art, you
know. <delay frames="40" /><anim id="Greeting" target="actor" targetSpec="" />And since I'm basically this
island's fashion icon<tag a="110" b="0" />
I figured it was, like, my duty<delay8 /><anim id="SmugFace" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> to
