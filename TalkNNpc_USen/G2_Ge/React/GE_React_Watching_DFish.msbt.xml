<tag a="50" b="0" arg="0x100 0xcd03" />horseshoe crab was totally, like,
a horn at first, <tag a="110" b="6" />.
<anim id="HappyFlower" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Which would have been tr√®s cool,
because that would mean this
crab was basically a unicorn!
<anim id="Serious" target="actor" targetSpec="" />But the pointy thing is just its tail.<delay frames="40" /><anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />
Which is still pretty cool,<delay8 /> but you
know.<tag a="110" b="0" /><anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />not UNICORN cool.</message>
