called hieroglyphs.
<anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />That means they're basically

say is that the model who posed for
the <tag a="50" b="0" arg="0x100 0xcd03" />gallant statue knew his stuff.
<anim id="Clapping" target="actor" targetSpec="" />That pose! <delay8 />That look! <delay8 />What a pro!<delay20 />
<anim id="Eh" target="actor" targetSpec="" />He must have been paid A LOT of
