free to leap into my arms.<pageBreak /><anim id="Grin" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I can't promise I'll catch you, but
it'll be hilarious!</message>

at the same time and started
crawling around everywhere?
<anim id="Frantic" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Oh<tag a="110" b="0" /><tag a="110" b="5" />!<delay20 /> I hope I didn't
just speak it into happening!</message>

to expose yourself to them like this
every so often.

when you find one unexpectedly!</message>

have to keep it that way for the
bugs, I think.

of the bugs in here.<pageBreak /><anim id="AbsentMindedness" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Someone else went to the trouble of
making a home just for them.<pageBreak /><anim id="WrySmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I'm still waiting for someone to do
