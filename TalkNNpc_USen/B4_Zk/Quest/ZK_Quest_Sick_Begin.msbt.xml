	<message label="002" attrib="00 00 00 01 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Serious" target="actor" targetSpec="" />You didn't hear this from me, but
<tag a="115" b="1" arg="0xcd00" /> is really sick
right now.
<anim id="Worried" target="actor" targetSpec="" />You should batten down your
hatches against germs and go
give <tag a="50" b="17" arg="0xf 0xcd00 0x6 0x68 0x69 0x6d 0x6 0x68 0x65 0x72 0x0" /> a visit.</message>
	<message label="003" attrib="00 00 00 01 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Worried" target="actor" targetSpec="" />So, I heard that <tag a="115" b="1" arg="0xcd00" />
got that <tag a="135" b="7" arg="0xcd00" /> flu that's
going around.
<anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />And apparently it's not as sweet
as it sounds, so maybe you should
go pay <gender3 m="him" f="her" /> a visit.</message>
