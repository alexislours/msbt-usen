<anim id="Negative" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I'm disappointed, but mostly with
myself for making it too hard.
<anim id="FaintSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I mean, I like to win, but I also like
to celebrate other folks' wins.<delay20 /><anim id="Grin" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> It's
a little thing I like to call<tag a="110" b="0" />win-win.</message>

have the winged goddess of victory
smile upon me.
<anim id="WrySmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />And you had the<tag a="110" b="0" />flat-footed demon
of defeat frown right at your face.<delay20 />
<anim id="Laughing" target="actor" targetSpec="" />But it's all in good fun!</message>

But look on the bright side—<delay20 /><anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />you
lost to the great <tag a="110" b="10" />!
<anim id="Grin" target="actor" targetSpec="" />No shame in that at all.</message>
	<message label="300" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Angry" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Well, that's one way for me to win.<delay20 />
<anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />By default!<pageBreak /><anim id="Silent" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Yeah, it's not as exciting as a regular
win.<delay frames="40" /> <anim id="Greeting" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Let's play again soon so I can
win for real!</message>
	<message label="301" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Sighing" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Ah, you finally came back.<delay20 /> I thought
maybe you moved to another island!<pageBreak /><anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Anyway, now that I know that
you're alright, let's call it a day.<delay20 />
<anim id="WrySmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Good game, I suppose<tag a="110" b="0" /></message>

whole island to have been gone
that long!
<anim id="WrySmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I'd tell you where I hid it, but<tag a="110" b="0" />
I already forgot. <delay20 /><anim id="Grin" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I guess we'll both
be hunting next time!</message>
	<message label="401" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Sighing" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Better late than never<tag a="110" b="0" />but not by
much this time.<pageBreak /><anim id="FaintSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I'll be holding onto that for now,
thank you very much.</message>
	<message label="402" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Don't worry. I'm sure you'll have
another chance soon enough.<pageBreak /><anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />And don't they say that failure
is the key to success?<10_4 /><anim id="Grin" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> That means you'll nail it next time, <tag a="110" b="5" />!</message>
