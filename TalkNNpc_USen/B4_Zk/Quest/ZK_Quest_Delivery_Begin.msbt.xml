realized that you're friends with
<tag a="115" b="1" arg="0xcd00" /> too!
<anim id="ShyBoy" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Well, I borrowed something from
<tag a="50" b="17" arg="0xf 0xcd00 0x6 0x68 0x69 0x6d 0x6 0x68 0x65 0x72 0x0" /> a looooong time ago, and I
keep meaning to return it.
<anim id="Scheming" target="actor" targetSpec="" />So, um<tag a="110" b="0" />I know it's a cool story,
but I was actually wondering if you'd
be interested in returning it for me.</message>
	<message label="001_a" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="EmotEnd" target="player" targetSpec="" />I could do that.</message>

over to visit a while ago, and <tag a="50" b="17" arg="0xf 0xcd00 0x4 0x68 0x65 0x6 0x73 0x68 0x65 0x0" />
left something at my place.
<anim id="ShyBoy" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I want to get it back to <tag a="50" b="17" arg="0xf 0xcd00 0x6 0x68 0x69 0x6d 0x6 0x68 0x65 0x72 0x0" /> right

<anim id="Frantic" target="actor" targetSpec="" />But I'm TRYING to make it a big deal!
<anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I thought maybe if you gave it to
<tag a="50" b="17" arg="0xf 0xcd00 0x6 0x68 0x69 0x6d 0x6 0x68 0x65 0x72 0x0" /> for me, it'd be a big surprise

listen to the plea of a tortured soul?<pageBreak /><anim id="Worried" target="actor" targetSpec="" />OK, I'm probably being melodramatic,
but I got into a prank war with
<tag a="115" b="1" arg="0xcd00" /> a while back.
<anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />And, well, I'm not sure who won
the war, but I've been feeling bad
about some of the things I did.
<anim id="Restless" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I even got <tag a="50" b="17" arg="0xf 0xcd00 0x6 0x68 0x69 0x6d 0x6 0x68 0x65 0x72 0x0" /> a present, but I'm
too shy to deliver it. <delay20 />Any chance
you could help me out?</message>

I can already see <tag a="115" b="1" arg="0xcd00" />
reacting. <delay20 /><anim id="Laughing" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Classic <tag a="115" b="1" arg="0xcd00" />!

one who just dropped this on you
out of nowhere.
<anim id="Worried" target="actor" targetSpec="" />No, I'll just have to go talk to
<tag a="115" b="1" arg="0xcd00" /> myself<tag a="110" b="0" /></message>
	<message label="106" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Worried" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Yeah, I guess I should probably
be the one to face the music
anyway, <tag a="110" b="5" />.
<anim id="Frantic" target="actor" targetSpec="" />What I'm saying is that
<tag a="115" b="1" arg="0xcd00" /> is going to
prank me with loud music<tag a="110" b="0" /></message>
	<message label="108" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="ShyBoy" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Also, no rush, but if you could
deliver that today, that'd be great.<pageBreak /><anim id="Shocked" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Oh, I forgot a comma. <delay20 />I meant
