huh? <delay20 />And how do you say its name?
Is it<tag a="110" b="0" />deinonychus?
<anim id="Serious" target="actor" targetSpec="" />More like deiNOPEnychus if you
ask me.</message>
	<message label="002" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="FaintSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Everything must have been bigger
back in the dinosaur times, right?<delay20 />
Like, just look at this giant deer.
<anim id="Eh" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It's straight-up giant!</message>
	<message label="003" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Serious" target="actor" targetSpec="" />So, this is a pteranodon<tag a="110" b="0" /> It looks
kinda rough now, but I bet it was
majestic in its time.
<anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Probably the <tag a="110" b="10" />
of the sky!</message>
	<message label="004" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Serious" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It's the most terrifying dinosaur of
all time<tag a="110" b="0" />T. Rex!<pageBreak /><anim id="Worried" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Too bad about that name though.<delay20 />
I could have come up with
something more scary.</message>
	<message label="005" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I think this dinosaur was a peaceful,
plant-eating one, <delay20 />but <anim id="Shocked" target="actor" targetSpec="" />MAN! <delay20 />Look
at those plates!
<anim id="Eh" target="actor" targetSpec="" />You could cut <tag a="50" b="2" /><tag a="135" b="5" arg="0xcd00" />
right in half with one of those
bad boys!</message>
	<message label="006" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Eh" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It's hard to imagine that creatures
this large were just walking around,
minding their own business<tag a="110" b="0" /></message>
	<message label="007" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Shocked" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Yo, those are some pointy tusks!<delay20 />
<anim id="Worried" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I'd probably poke myself constantly
if I had tusks like that.</message>
	<message label="008" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />This thing HAD to be the smile

at those big, beautiful chompers!</message>

<anim id="Shocked" target="actor" targetSpec="" />WHAT? <10_4 /><anim id="Worried" target="actor" targetSpec="" />With confusing branding like
that, no wonder it went extinct.</message>
	<message label="010" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Serious" target="actor" targetSpec="" />They say that the <tag a="50" b="0" arg="0x100 0xcd03" />dunkleosteus
got its name from how hard it
would dunk on smaller fish.
<anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Just kidding!<delay frames="40" /> <anim id="Serious" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It's from how it 
would dunk proto-donuts in its
mesozoic mocha every morning.</message>

a fossil now?<pageBreak /><anim id="Serious" target="actor" targetSpec="" />This explains how horrible fashions

And I'm here lecturing you about
it like a know-it-all. <delay20 />So cool!</message>
	<message label="201" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Eh" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Uhh<tag a="110" b="0" />that kinda looks like my uncle.<delay20 />
But it can't be, right? <delay20 />This thing is,
like, thousands of years old.
<anim id="Worried" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Then again, Uncle Joe is
pretty wrinkly<tag a="110" b="0" /></message>
