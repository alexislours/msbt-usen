you're in the middle of something
right now.

but we can do it later.<pageBreak /><anim id="Serious" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Someone will find you once you
say goodbye to your friend.<pageBreak /><anim id="Laughing" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Ha HA! <delay20 />Doesn't that sound ominous?<delay20 /><anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> Don't worry, it's nothing bad.</message>

<anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />But there's someone else
here who needs to talk to
<tag a="115" b="0" arg="0xcd00" />, like, soon-ish.
<anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Yeah, I think it has to be today.<delay frames="40" />
<anim id="Eh" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Maybe it's about an audition!<delay20 />
Anyway, it seems important.
<anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Just be sure to tell them that
someone's looking for them and
wants to talk to them alone.
<anim id="WrySmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I'm 95 percent sure it's not a scam.</message>
