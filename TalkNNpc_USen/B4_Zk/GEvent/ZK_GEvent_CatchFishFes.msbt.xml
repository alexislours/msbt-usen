catching fish for the Fishing
Tourney in a nutshell<tag a="110" b="0" />
<anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />If you examine the moral teachings
of some of the 18th century's
pre-eminent thinkers<tag a="110" b="0" />
<anim id="BigSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />you'd be super bored!<delay20 /> Just go
catch some fish, <tag a="110" b="5" />!</message>

catch 100 fish today.<pageBreak /><anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I mean, yeah, I could be winning
the whole tourney. <delay20 /><anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />But I want to

no idea I'd do so well! <delay20 />And I couldn't
have done it without my fans.
<anim id="QuestionMark" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Do you know if the MVP award is a
trophy, or a medal, or<tag a="110" b="0" />?<delay20 /><anim id="SmugFace" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> I just need
to free up some space in my display.</message>

rather be caught than the one
doing the catching, <tag a="110" b="5" />.
