pull it together. <delay20 />The tourney is

<anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Maybe sleeping with my fishing pole
in the bed wasn't the best idea
after all<tag a="110" b="0" /></message>

catching fish for the Fishing
Tourney in a nutshell<tag a="110" b="0" />
<anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />If you examine the moral teachings
of some of the 18th century's
pre-eminent thinkers<tag a="110" b="0" />
<anim id="BigSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />you'd be super bored!<delay20 /> Just go
catch some fish, <tag a="110" b="5" />!</message>

going for you? <delay frames="40" /><anim id="QuestionMark" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Reel sizzling and
all that?</message>

catch 100 fish today.<pageBreak /><anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I mean, yeah, I could be winning
the whole tourney. <delay20 /><anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />But I want to
win it in STYLE, <tag a="110" b="5" />!</message>

no idea I'd do so well! <delay20 />And I couldn't
have done it without my fans.
<anim id="QuestionMark" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Do you know if the MVP award is a
trophy, or a medal, or<tag a="110" b="0" />?<delay20 /><anim id="SmugFace" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> I just need
to free up some space in my display.</message>
	<message label="008" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="ShyBoy" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I don't know about you, but I'd
rather be caught than the one
doing the catching, <tag a="110" b="5" />.
<anim id="Pardon" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Ha HA<tag a="110" b="0" /> Er<tag a="110" b="0" /></message>

today, hmm?<pageBreak /><anim id="SmugFace" target="actor" targetSpec="" />The results may not show up on

the event in my own way.</message>

of a competition like this? <delay8 />The give
and take? <delay8 />The win and lose?
<anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Sorry, I'm just trying to make
conversation.<delay20 /> <anim id="Negative" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I don't know

the blink of an eye, almost like
being struck by lightning<tag a="110" b="0" />
<anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Oh, just talking about the one that
got away. <delay frames="40" /><anim id="Dance" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It was THIS BIG!</message>

want to scare off the fish, you know?<delay frames="40" />
<anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />You've got to be smooth.
<anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />If you get too close too soon, you'll
just freak them out. <delay20 /><anim id="Serious" target="actor" targetSpec="" />We're still
talking about fishing, <tag a="110" b="5" />.</message>

no.<delay8 /> You can't say me.<pageBreak /><anim id="SmugFace" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Though I would prefer to keep this
small pond all to myself.</message>
	<message label="105" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="AbsentMindedness" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Ah, the distinct and natural aroma of
fish<tag a="110" b="0" /><delay20 /> There's nothing quite like it,<delay20 /><anim id="Serious" target="actor" targetSpec="" />
and for that<delay8 /> I am grateful.</message>

really come naturally to me.<pageBreak /><anim id="Frantic" target="actor" targetSpec="" />But please don't tell anyone I said
that! <delay20 /><anim id="Worried" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It's listed on my resume under

everywhere I go, <tag a="110" b="5" />.</message>
