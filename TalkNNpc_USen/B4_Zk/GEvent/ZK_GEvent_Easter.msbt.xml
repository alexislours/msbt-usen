I see you eyeing my dashing,<delay20 /> <anim id="SmugFace" target="actor" targetSpec="" />yet
seasonally appropriate attire.
<anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Bunny Day only comes once a year,<delay20 />
so I don't get a lot of opportunities
to show off this outfit, <tag a="110" b="5" />.
<anim id="BrokenHeart" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It's a shame, really.</message>
	<message label="002" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="QuestionMark" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Have you seen the way <colour id="3" />Zipper<colour id="65535" /> struts
around, <tag a="110" b="3" />?<pageBreak /><anim id="AbsentMindedness" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Such confidence<tag a="110" b="0" /><delay40 /> Such poise<tag a="110" b="0" /><delay40 />
Such<tag a="110" b="0" /><delay40 /><anim id="Shocked" target="actor" targetSpec="" />mystery.<pageBreak /><anim id="Eh" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I wonder what folks think when they
see me walking around.<pageBreak /><anim id="Blushing" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I assume it's a well-balanced mixture
of jealousy and awe.</message>
	<message label="003" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Hello" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Heads up, <tag a="110" b="3" />.<delay40 />
<anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />We can totally eat any Bunny Day
eggs that we find or receive.
<anim id="Negative" target="actor" targetSpec="" />But just because we can<delay20 /> doesn't
mean we should, <tag a="110" b="5" />.<pageBreak /><anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Some of those candies are beautiful
enough to be works of art.<pageBreak />Eating one would be like<delay20 /><anim id="Frantic" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> taking a
bite out of me in a tuxedo!</message>
	<message label="011" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Hello" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I know you're on the hunt for eggs,
<tag a="110" b="3" />, <anim id="Scheming" target="actor" targetSpec="" />but don't forget
to look up every now and again.
<anim id="Sighing" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Sure, sure, <delay20 />to appreciate the beauty
of the sky and how small we are,
and all that stuff<tag a="110" b="0" />
<anim id="BigSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />But more importantly,<delay40 /> <anim id="Scheming" target="actor" targetSpec="" />you never
know when you'll see a special Bunny
Day balloon<delay8 /> waiting to be shot down.</message>
	<message label="012" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Hello" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I was taking a stroll on the beach<delay8 />
when I saw a bottle as colorful as a
Bunny Day egg lying in the surf.
<anim id="ShyBoy" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I didn't read the note inside,<delay20 /><anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> but I
can only assume its appearance has
something to do with Bunny Day.
<anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Either that or the writer collects
unusually shaped bottles<delay20 /> and
throws them into the ocean<tag a="110" b="0" />
<anim id="Frantic" target="actor" targetSpec="" /><delay20 />hoping that their long-lost love will
find one and use the shape as a clue<delay20 /><anim id="Love" target="actor" targetSpec="" />
to reunite with their beloved!
<anim id="IdeaBulb" target="actor" targetSpec="" /><delay20 />The screenplay practically writes
itself, <tag a="110" b="5" />.</message>
	<message label="104" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Aha" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I don't want to alarm you,
<tag a="110" b="3" />,<delay20 /> but I just saw
a strange egg floating in the sky.
<anim id="TakenAback" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Really?<delay20 /> You aren't concerned?<delay40 />
<anim id="QuestionMark" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Not even a little?<pageBreak /><anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Hm.<delay40 /><anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> I guess Bunny Day IS predicated
on the idea of a rabbit laying eggs.<delay40 />
<anim id="WrySmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Doesn't get much weirder than that.</message>
	<message label="105" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />If you're looking for something fun to
do in celebration of Bunny Day,<delay20 /><anim id="Scheming" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> might
I suggest you shake a few trees?
<anim id="WrySmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Apparently, you just may be
rewarded with a beautifully
decorated egg, <tag a="110" b="3" />.
<anim id="Hesitate" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I'd love to show you one myself,<delay20 />
but I've shaken over a hundred trees<anim id="Oops" target="actor" targetSpec="" />
and I've got nothing to show for it.
<anim id="Frantic" target="actor" targetSpec="" />What if it's a Bunny Day curse?!</message>
	<message label="106" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />So there I was,<delay20 /> just enjoying a nice
run-of-the-mill fishing trip,<delay8 /> when I
reeled in something<tag a="110" b="0" /><delay40 /><anim id="Eh" target="actor" targetSpec="" />unexpected.
At first I thought,<delay20 /><anim id="IdeaBulb" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> "I've discovered a
new species of fish!"<delay40 /><anim id="Negative" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> But I wasn't
looking at a fish.
<anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I was looking at an egg!<pageBreak /><anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Of course, I was happy because I
love Bunny Day,<delay40 /><anim id="Sighing" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> but then again<tag a="110" b="0" /><pageBreak /><anim id="Crying" target="actor" targetSpec="" />You can't achieve worldwide fame
with an egg, <tag a="110" b="3" />!</message>
