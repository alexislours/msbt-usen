the Bug-Off that I couldn't sleep
last night.
<anim id="Sleepy" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Hope I don't fall asleep with
the net in my hands today<tag a="110" b="0" /></message>
	<message label="002" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Shocked" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It's almost time for the Bug-Off!<delay20 /><anim id="Frantic" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> I'm
just pacing and twitching nervously
to calm my nerves, obviously.</message>
	<message label="003" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Serious" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It's here<tag a="110" b="0" />the big bug blowout<tag a="110" b="0" />
<anim id="Dance" target="actor" targetSpec="" />The Bug-Off starts at 9:00 AM!<pageBreak /><anim id="WrySmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Are you ready, <tag a="110" b="3" />?</message>
	<message label="004" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Now, the way I approach a typical
Bug-Off is to try to get inside
the head of a bug.
<anim id="QuestionMark" target="actor" targetSpec="" />What motivates the bug? <delay8 />What
drives the bug to BE a bug?<delay20 />
<anim id="Scheming" target="actor" targetSpec="" />And that is how I CATCH the bug.
<anim id="Angry" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Hey!<delay20 /> Are you writing this all down
or what?</message>
	<message label="005" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Greeting" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Heya! <delay20 />You bringing in the bugs
or what, <tag a="110" b="5" />?</message>
	<message label="006" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I still haven't found a bug with
just the right FEEL, you know?<pageBreak /><anim id="Angry" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Yes, I'm aware of how this contest
works, thank you very much!</message>
	<message label="007" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Blushing" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Wow, what an event.<delay20 /> I want to
thank the organizers, the fans,
really everyone involved<tag a="110" b="0" />
<anim id="SmugFace" target="actor" targetSpec="" />If anyone wants to interview me,
I've got copies of my rider available
and my own sound team.</message>
	<message label="008" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I'm not really used to chasing
anything, you know?<delay20 /><anim id="WrySmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> I'm used to
the paparazzi chasing me!</message>
	<message label="009" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="QuestionMark" target="actor" targetSpec="" />So, how'd you do in the Bug-Off?<pageBreak /><anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Me? <anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Well, I don't like to measure
my performance strictly in terms
of "bugs caught," you know?
<anim id="SmugFace" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I have my data team working on
the analytics right now.</message>
	<message label="010" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />The Bug-Off is a delicate game of
cat and mouse, you see<tag a="110" b="0" /><pageBreak /><anim id="WrySmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Today I was the cat, but you never
know what tomorrow will bring.</message>

interesting things to say, but
we're in the middle of the Bug-Off!</message>
	<message label="012" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="AbsentMindedness" target="actor" targetSpec="" />You know that feeling, when you
catch the perfect bug?<delay20 /> It's like,<delay20 />
<anim id="ColdChill" target="actor" targetSpec="" />chills, you know!
<anim id="WrySmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I also get the same feeling from
picking out the right pair of shoes
to wear, so maybe it's just me.</message>
	<message label="013" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Bug catching is all about positioning.<delay20 />
You've gotta be at just the right
distance when you strike.
<anim id="SmugFace" target="actor" targetSpec="" />If you do it just right, the bug will
practically jump onto your net.<pageBreak /><anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />But get too close,<delay20 /><anim id="Oops" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> and he'll be on the
next flight off this island!</message>

bugs yet, <tag a="110" b="3" />?<pageBreak /><anim id="Hesitate" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I'd tell you about the ones I netted,<delay8 />
<anim id="SmugFace" target="actor" targetSpec="" />but I don't want to brag. <delay20 />I hope you
understand, <tag a="110" b="5" />.</message>
	<message label="105" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00">Oof! <anim id="Hot" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Who knew that bug catching
would be so physically exhausting?<delay20 />
<anim id="Sighing" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Everything's sore, <tag a="110" b="5" />.
<anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />But you know what that means<tag a="110" b="0" /><delay20 />
<anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Time for a bubble bath! <delay20 /><anim id="BigSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Fancy bath
