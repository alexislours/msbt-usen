didn't we?<delay20 /><anim id="Negative" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> But the bright lights
of another island are calling me<tag a="110" b="0" />
<anim id="AbsentMindedness" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I suppose I'll spend the day
reminiscing over a hot mug
of <tag a="135" b="1" arg="0xcd00" /><tag a="110" b="0" /></message>

as much of <tag a="110" b="8" /> to
memory as I can.
<anim id="AbsentMindedness" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Yep, I'll think back fondly on the
place where it all started for me<tag a="110" b="0" /></message>

goodbye to <tag a="110" b="8" />.<pageBreak /><anim id="AbsentMindedness" target="actor" targetSpec="" />When I think of this place, I'll think
of <tag a="135" b="3" arg="0xcd00" /> and <tag a="110" b="7" arg="0xcd01" /><tag a="110" b="0" /><pageBreak /><anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Perhaps not the greatest combo.<delay20 />
But then again, that's part of why
I'm moving.</message>
