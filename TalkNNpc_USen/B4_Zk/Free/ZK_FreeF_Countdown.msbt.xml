<tag a="110" b="10" />, I can tell
you that.
<anim id="Grin" target="actor" targetSpec="" />And if we get to hang out during
the Countdown tonight, it'll just
keep on getting better.</message>
	<message label="002" attrib="00 00 00 27 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Hello" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Will I see you tonight? <delay20 />At the main
plaza an hour before midnight?<pageBreak /><anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />C'mon! <delay20 />Let's send <tag a="90" b="27" /> out in
style together, <tag a="110" b="3" />!</message>
	<message label="003" attrib="00 00 00 27 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Hello" target="actor" targetSpec="" />You know that the big Countdown
is tonight, right?<delay20 /> At the main plaza?<pageBreak /><anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I know it's late, but you'll be having
so much fun that it'll seem early.<pageBreak /><anim id="WrySmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />And then when the clock ticks over,
it will actually BE early. <delay20 />Ha HA!</message>
	<message label="004" attrib="00 00 00 27 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Some folks like to jump right
as the clock ticks over midnight
into a new year.
<anim id="QuestionMark" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Why do they do it? <delay20 />Is it just
superstition?<delay20 /><anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> Or is it, like,
quantum mechanics?
<anim id="Aha" target="actor" targetSpec="" />You know,<delay20 /> like, <delay20 />you have to leap
across space-time into the new
year<tag a="110" b="0" />or something?
<anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I don't actually know quantum
mechanics. <delay frames="40" />I'm <tag a="50" b="2" /><tag a="110" b="15" />,
not a cat!</message>
