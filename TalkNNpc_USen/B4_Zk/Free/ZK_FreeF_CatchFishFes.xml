Some call it the Battle of the Bass.<delay20 />
Others, the Clash of the Cod<tag a="110" b="0" />
<anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />But here on <tag a="110" b="8" />, we
just call it a Fishing Tourney.<delay20 />
<anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Let the best angler win!</message>

good today, <tag a="110" b="3" />?<pageBreak /><anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" /><tag a="50" b="3" /><tag a="110" b="5" />, you don't have to
answer that.<delay20 /> I'm just getting ready
for the Fishing Tourney!
<anim id="Angry" target="actor" targetSpec="" />What do you mean it's fishing
for actual fish?<delay frames="40" /> <anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Fishing for
compliments is way more fun.</message>
	<message label="003" attrib="00 00 00 27 00 00 00 00"><anim id="QuestionMark" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Did you know that a Fishing Tourney
is coming up, <tag a="110" b="3" />?<pageBreak /><anim id="AbsentMindedness" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Ahh, allow me to wax poetic for
just a moment and explain how
fishing<tag a="110" b="0" /><anim id="Serious" target="actor" targetSpec="" />is a game of love.
You see, in fishing AND in love,<anim id="Negative" target="actor" targetSpec="" />
you don't want to get too crazy
at the first sign of a nibble.
<anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It takes finesse and caring—really
being tuned into the subtlest clues—
to land a truly special catch.</message>
	<message label="004" attrib="00 00 00 26 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Got a pro tip on the Fishing Tourney
for you, <tag a="110" b="3" />.<pageBreak /><anim id="Negative" target="actor" targetSpec="" />They don't count fish that you catch
beforehand, so save all your luck
for the actual event.</message>

Tourney, right? <delay20 />You gotta go talk
to <colour id="3" />C.J.<colour id="65535" /> in the plaza.
<anim id="Negative" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Oh, I won't be joining this time
around. <delay20 /><anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I just got all the fish smell
out of my clothes from last time!</message>
