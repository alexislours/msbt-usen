over it completely?</message>

at <tag a="135" b="8" arg="0xcd00" /> if I hadn't
practiced relentlessly.
<anim id="Grin" target="actor" targetSpec="" />The key is to keep trying over and
over again, even if you're driving
everyone else around you nuts.</message>
	<message label="003" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I mean, I guess there's a slight
downside if you let everything else
in your life fade away<tag a="110" b="0" />
<anim id="Grin" target="actor" targetSpec="" />But the upside is that I'm incredible
at <tag a="135" b="8" arg="0xcd00" /> now, so<tag a="110" b="0" /><delay20 />

interesting story<tag a="110" b="0" /><pageBreak /><anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />But I'll just give you the highlights.<delay20 />
Massive success, world tour, fans
chanting our names<tag a="110" b="0" />
<anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />The usual! <delay frames="40" /><anim id="WrySmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />And we topped it all off
with a huge public breakup just
like a legendary rock band should.</message>
	<message label="011" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Ah, it's such a good story<tag a="110" b="0" /><anim id="Negative" target="actor" targetSpec="" />but I
am legally prohibited from sharing
all of the details at this time.
<anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Let's just say that a number of city
ordinances were violated by certain
band members.
<anim id="AbsentMindedness" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Yep, that was a good show<tag a="110" b="0" /></message>
	<message label="012" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Alright, alright. I'll spare you
the details. <delay20 /><anim id="WrySmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Just know that we're

we had a difference of musical

is? <delay20 />When folks call plants that they

And they're some of the toughest
in the plant kingdom!
<anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Think about it.<delay8 /> Folks are actively
trying to eradicate them, and they
just keep on thriving everywhere!
<anim id="AbsentMindedness" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I wish I was as tough as some

	<message label="019" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />We should show some respect and
at least learn their names!<pageBreak /><anim id="Aha" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Like goosegrass.<delay8 /> It'll grow anywhere!<delay20 />
I think there's some growing inside
my refrigerator!
<anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" /><tag a="50" b="3" /><tag a="110" b="5" />, if folks could be

parties in my neighborhood.<delay20 />
Everyone would show up!
<anim id="ShyBoy" target="actor" targetSpec="" />The thing is<tag a="110" b="0" />I didn't know how
to dance. <delay20 />So I used to play the
piano while everyone else got down.
<anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Now I'm a world-class dancer, but I
can't string two notes together on
the piano.

<anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />One time I saw someone give a girl
some flowers in a movie, so I started
doing that with everyone.
<anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Pretty soon, folks came to expect
flowers from me almost every day,

<tag a="50" b="3" /><tag a="135" b="3" arg="0xcd01" />? <delay8 />Ketchup. <delay20 />And
<tag a="135" b="3" arg="0xcd02" />? <delay20 /><anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Yup! Ketchup.
<anim id="Worried" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Then one day, I spilled the bottle
of ketchup that I carried around
in my backpack.<delay20 /><anim id="Negative" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> IN my backpack.

hack it.
<anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Sometimes they'd just sit there

totally blending in.
<anim id="SmugFace" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I had to show them how it was done!<delay20 />
You've gotta draw attention to
yourself if you want to be featured!
