some sort of special meaning.<pageBreak />Like, <delay20 /><anim id="Love" target="actor" targetSpec="" />maybe red ones are supposed
to be the color of love <delay40 /><anim id="HappyFlower" target="actor" targetSpec="" />and blue ones
represent friendship.
<anim id="WrySmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />The white ones are my favorite.<delay40 />
<anim id="SmugFace" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I'm guessing they symbolize
budding celebrity, <tag a="110" b="5" />.</message>

the fashion event of the year.<pageBreak /><anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It's the only time eggs get to shake
off their normally bland exterior and<delay20 /><anim id="BigSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />
experiment with bold new looks.
<anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I used to have an egg fashion line
of my very own, but<delay40 /><anim id="Oops" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> I kept eating

want to catch a fish, you end up
catching an egg instead?<pageBreak /><anim id="SmugFace" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Well<tag a="110" b="0" />I've worked out a kind of
system that's more reliable than
my agent not calling me back.<pageBreak /><anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />See, eggs have the same size
shadow as a medium-sized fish.<pageBreak /><anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />So if you NEED a fish, go for a tiny
shadow or a huge one!<delay20 /> You want to
maybe catch an egg? <delay20 /><anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Go medium!</message>
