<tag a="110" b="3" />? <10_4 /><anim id="Cheering" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It's the Bug-Off!<pageBreak /><anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />If we all work hard today, we can
make sure that <tag a="110" b="8" /> is
bug-free forever!
<anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" /><tag a="110" b="0" />Is that not the point of the event?</message>
	<message label="002" attrib="00 00 00 27 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Negative" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I've never liked the term "bugs."<delay20 />
There are so many different kinds!<delay20 />
<anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It's rude to simplify like that.
<anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />You've got insects, arachnids,
myriapods<tag a="110" b="0" />the list goes on!<pageBreak /><anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I suppose they do have one thing
in common. <delay20 /><anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />They all count in
the Bug-Off!</message>
	<message label="003" attrib="00 00 00 27 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />You know what catching bugs is
like? <delay20 />It's kind of like making new
friends, <tag a="110" b="5" />.
<anim id="Negative" target="actor" targetSpec="" />You can't come on too strong or
you'll scare folks away.<delay20 /> So you
move in slowly with a smile.
<anim id="Serious" target="actor" targetSpec="" />And when you finally get close,
that's when you swing the net
and trap them forever!
<anim id="Oops" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Wait, what were we talking about?</message>
	<message label="004" attrib="00 00 00 26 00 00 00 00"><anim id="QuestionMark" target="actor" targetSpec="" />You know how the Bug-Off works,
right?<delay20 /> <anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />You're trying to catch as many
bugs as you can in a short time.
<anim id="Angry" target="actor" targetSpec="" />So don't go trying to catch a whole
bunch of bugs before the event,
because those don't count!</message>
	<message label="005" attrib="00 00 00 26 00 00 00 00"><anim id="QuestionMark" target="actor" targetSpec="" />You know how to enter the
Bug-Off, right? <delay20 />Just go talk to
<colour id="3" />Flick <colour id="65535" />in the plaza.
<anim id="Eh" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Me?<delay frames="40" /><anim id="Negative" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> I'm gonna pass on this one.<delay20 />
I inhaled a bug by accident this
morning and that was enough.</message>
