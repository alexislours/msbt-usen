<anim id="Frantic" target="actor" targetSpec="" />What do I do with my hands?
<anim id="Restless" target="actor" targetSpec="" />So I thought maybe I could practice

I think I nailed it!

my parents. <delay20 /><anim id="SadSpiral" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It's always so awkward
when they ask me questions.

with your life?" and "Why won't you
tell us where you live?" <delay20 />Ugh!
<anim id="Restless" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Anyway, I want you to pretend
that you're my dad. <delay20 />You got

to this live performance of my

<20_2 arg="5" /><anim id="Serious" target="actor" targetSpec="" />But before we get started, I just
need to let you know that I don't
work for free, <tag a="110" b="5" />.
<anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Your presence indicates that you

again. <delay20 />My face is already on waaaaay
too many T-shirts. <delay20 /><anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Don't ask.
<anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />But wait.<delay20 /> What was that thing
you said? <delay20 /><tag a="50" b="3" /><tag a="110" b="5" />, was it?<10_4 />
<anim id="Blushing" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It<tag a="110" b="0" />actually kinda rocked.</message>

<tag a="110" b="5" />, then hook 'em with
the interpretive dance.
<anim id="Grin" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Works every time. <delay frames="40" /><anim id="QuestionMark" target="actor" targetSpec="" />So, what size
T-shirt should I put you down for?<pageBreak /><anim id="SmugFace" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Trick question. <delay20 />I only ordered XW—
that's extra wide—<delay20 />so that I could fit
my entire website link on them.</message>
	<message label="204" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Angry" target="actor" targetSpec="" />First, that's not how T-shirts work.<delay20 />
Second, that's not how fishing
works. <delay20 />Third, and most importantly<tag a="110" b="0" />
<10_10 />Put my face on a T-shirt
at your own risk, <tag a="110" b="5" />!<pageBreak /><10_9 /><anim id="BigSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Wow! <delay20 />That felt great.<delay20 /> And saying
<tag a="110" b="5" /> really added some
spice to my threat.
<anim id="Grin" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I think I'll keep on using it!</message>
	<message label="205" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Alright, alright<tag a="110" b="0" />no T-shirts.<10_4 />
