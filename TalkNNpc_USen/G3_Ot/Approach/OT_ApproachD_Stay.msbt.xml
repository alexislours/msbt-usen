must talk to you about.<pageBreak /><anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />You remember when I told you I was
moving away from the island?<delay frames="40" />
Well<tag a="110" b="0" /><anim id="FaintSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I've changed my mind.
<anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I spoke to <tag a="115" b="0" arg="0xcd00" />,
and they convinced me to stay<tag a="110" b="0" /><pageBreak /><anim id="ShyBoy" target="actor" targetSpec="" />They were VERY persuasive, you see,<delay8 />
and I simply couldn't say no.<delay frames="40" /> <anim id="FaintSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />So, it
seems you're not rid of me just yet!</message>
	<message label="002" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Greeting" target="actor" targetSpec="" />So darling, <delay8 />funny story<tag a="110" b="0" /><anim id="Blushing" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> Remember
when I got that wild hair to move
away from the island?
<anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Yes, <delay8 />well,<delay8 /> <anim id="Negative" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I'm not going to do that.<delay20 />
I have changed my mind! Or rather,
<tag a="115" b="0" arg="0xcd00" /> changed it.
<anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />They practically BEGGED me to stay!<delay20 />
What could I do?<pageBreak /><anim id="HappyFlower" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Anyhoo,<delay8 /> you should count yourself
lucky!<delay20 /> <anim id="FaintSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />You get to continue enjoying
my company, <delay8 />after all!</message>

<anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Well,<delay20 /> <anim id="Negative" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I'm not moving after all.<pageBreak /><anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />After we talked, <delay8 />I had a little chat
with <tag a="115" b="0" arg="0xcd00" /><tag a="110" b="0" /><delay20 /><anim id="Eh" target="actor" targetSpec="" />and they
told me they didn't want me to go!
<anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />They're such a dear, <delay8 />I simply
couldn't stand the thought
of disappointing them.
<anim id="Blushing" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Sorry for the fuss. <delay20 />Let's just forget
that conversation ever happened,<delay8 />
shall we?</message>

business about me moving away?<delay20 />
<anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />You can forget about that!
<anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />After we talked,<delay8 /> I had a good
long think.<delay20 /> <anim id="QuestionMark" target="actor" targetSpec="" />And do you know
what I realized?<pageBreak /><anim id="BigSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I realized that <tag a="110" b="8" /> is
my home!<pageBreak /><anim id="Blushing" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I also realized that moving is a great
deal of work and might cut into my 
beauty rest.<delay8 /><anim id="Eh" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> But, I digress<tag a="110" b="0" />
<anim id="Sighing" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I'm sorry I caused all that turmoil.<delay20 /><anim id="FaintSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />
