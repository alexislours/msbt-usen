You're just in time to be the first
to hear my exciting news.
<anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Ideally you'd be sitting down for this,
but<tag a="110" b="0" />I've decided that I'm going to
be moving away!
<anim id="Negative" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Now, don't be distraught. <delay8 />I don't
dislike you or any of my wonderfully
down-to-earth neighbors.
<anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />But I believe it's time I moved on.<delay20 />
