moment, but you're welcome to make
yourself comfortable.
Just, <delay8 /><anim id="Negative" target="actor" targetSpec="" />don't go and do anything
strange simply because this is
a dream, <tag a="110" b="6" />.
<anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Actually, darling,<delay20 /> I take that back.<delay20 />
<anim id="Laughing" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Now is the perfect time to do
something weird.</message>

darling<tag a="110" b="0" />yet totally NOT normal at
the same time.<pageBreak /><anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I mean, this is a dream, <delay8 /><anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />so I suppose
that's to be expected, <tag a="110" b="6" />.<pageBreak />If the walls of my home suddenly
turned into <tag a="135" b="7" arg="0xcd01" />,<delay8 /><anim id="Laughing" target="actor" targetSpec="" />
I suppose that would feel normal too.</message>

when I tell you that you're looking
rather dreamy, <tag a="110" b="3" />.
It's just<tag a="110" b="0" /><anim id="Laughing" target="actor" targetSpec="" />this IS a dream, so the
description seems rather apt right
now, <tag a="110" b="6" />.</message>

a dream, and ALL I want to do is
entertain visitors in lavish style<tag a="110" b="0" />
And yet<tag a="110" b="0" /><anim id="Angry" target="actor" targetSpec="" />where is my castle?<delay20 />
Where is my palace?<delay20 /> <anim id="Fuming" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Where is my
ROYAL ESTATE?!
Alas,<anim id="Sighing" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> this dream home of mine is
infuriatingly realistic, <tag a="110" b="6" />.</message>
