choral exercise?<pageBreak /><anim id="Greeting" target="actor" targetSpec="" />You sing really, really loud,<delay20 /><anim id="HappyDance" target="actor" targetSpec="" />
and the effort strengthens
your stomach muscles.
<anim id="ShyBoy" target="actor" targetSpec="" />But my neighbor told me everyone
can hear me when I sing in the tub,
<anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />so that was a little embarrassing<tag a="110" b="0" /></message>
	<message label="004" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Greeting" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I saw this new kind of workout on

and it's all the rage!
<anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />You simply go to a store and put
ALL the things you want to buy
in a shopping basket<tag a="110" b="0" />
<anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />You make sure it's nice and heavy<tag a="110" b="0" /><delay20 />
<anim id="BigSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />and then you get an amazing arm
workout just by carrying it around!
<anim id="Love" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Shopping and exercising at the

was a two-for-one sale happening!<delay20 />
<anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />So of course I got four.

They smell JUST like roses.

And they smelled SO good!<pageBreak /><anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Best of all, they're less expensive
than bath gels,<delay frames="13" /> <anim id="HappyDance" target="actor" targetSpec="" />and make me feel
