I'm very mindful to only
catch them temporarily.<pageBreak /><anim id="AbsentMindedness" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Even if I scare them away,<anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> I find
it so moving to watch them fly
off into the vast blue sky.</message>

believe what's happened!<delay40 /><anim id="Sighing" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> Oh, well.
There are other fish in the sea.
<tag a="110" b="0" /><anim id="Surprised" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Huh? A broken heart?<delay40 /> <anim id="Laughing" target="actor" targetSpec="" />No, no, no!<delay40 />
I was literally talking about fishing.<delay40 />
<anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Though<tag a="110" b="0" />I see how I confused you.
<anim id="Blushing" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I guess maybe the struggles of love
and fishing aren't so different!</message>

watering can and watering the plants
<anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />is a big part of my daily routine.<pageBreak /><anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />When I take care of them every day,
I feel love welling up in my heart.<delay40 /><pageBreak /><anim id="QuestionMark" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Maybe it's my maternal instinct?<delay40 />
<anim id="Blushing" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I even give them secret little names.
"Plantina" is my favorite.</message>

expresses its owner's personality
even more than clothes.
<anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />After all, clothes can look good or
look bad on somebody,<delay20 /> <anim id="ShyBoy" target="actor" targetSpec="" />so shopping
involves a lot of deliberation, no?<pageBreak /><anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />But you only use umbrellas now and
then, <delay20 /><anim id="Hello" target="actor" targetSpec="" />so you can just buy a design
you like without thinking too hard.</message>
