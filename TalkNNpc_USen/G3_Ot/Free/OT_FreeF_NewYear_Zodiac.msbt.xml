sign is the rat. <delay20 /><anim id="SmugFace" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I say it's time we little
ones get a wee bit more attention!
<anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Of course,<delay8 /> a whole year in the
limelight might be exhausting
for some.
<anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Not me, darling! <delay20 />I'm ready to show
the world<delay frames="13" /><anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> that fabulous things
come in small packages.</message>
	<message label="002" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />You know, <delay frames="13" /><tag a="90" b="27" /> is the Year of the Ox.<delay frames="40" />
<anim id="SmugFace" target="actor" targetSpec="" />But I think I shall call it the Year of
the Cow, <tag a="110" b="6" />.
<anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I had planned to spend the year
blending into the background here
on <tag a="110" b="8" />.
<anim id="Negative" target="actor" targetSpec="" />But no!<delay20 /> It's time I grab the bull by
the horns <delay frames="13" /><anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />and shine for all cow-kind!</message>
	<message label="003" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="FaintSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It's the Year of the Tiger, you know.<delay20 />
That means<tag a="110" b="0" /><anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />it's the Year of
<tag a="110" b="10" />!
That must be why my fur <delay8 /><anim id="Dance" target="actor" targetSpec="" />looks
even more fabulous than usual,
<tag a="110" b="6" />!</message>
	<message label="004" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Did you hear?<delay8 /> <tag a="90" b="27" /> is the Year of
the Rabbit.<delay20 /> That's right!<delay frames="13" /><anim id="SmugFace" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> It is
MY year, <tag a="110" b="6" />!
<anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I do hope the year doesn't just
race by.<delay frames="40" /> <anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I must be sure to slow
down and truly appreciate it.</message>
	<message label="005" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00">Why, <tag a="110" b="3" />,<delay frames="13" /> <anim id="Hello" target="actor" targetSpec="" />do you
know what this year is?<delay frames="40" /> <anim id="BigSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It's the
Year of the Horse, <tag a="110" b="6" />!
<anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />The Year of the Horse takes place
only once every 12 years, if you
can believe it.
<anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Of course, you heard it straight from
the horse's mouth, <anim id="Grin" target="actor" targetSpec="" />so I assure you<tag a="110" b="0" />
you CAN believe it.</message>
	<message label="006" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00">I realize that <tag a="90" b="27" /> is the Year of the
Sheep<tag a="110" b="0" /><delay frames="13" />but it's not like anything
changes for me, <tag a="110" b="6" />.
<anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I'm just going to do what I
always do<tag a="110" b="0" /><delay frames="13" /><anim id="FaintSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> Pamper myself
and shop for shoes.
<anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Though now that I think about it,<delay8 />
<anim id="Grin" target="actor" targetSpec="" />perhaps I DO deserve to buy an
extra pair of shoes or five.</message>
	<message label="007" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="FaintSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />At long last, <tag a="110" b="5" />,<delay8 /> it is the
Year of the Monkey.<delay20 /> <anim id="Serious" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It comes only
once every 12 years,<delay8 /> you know.
<anim id="Negative" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It really should happen more often.<delay20 />
<anim id="Grin" target="actor" targetSpec="" />After all, everyone enjoys having an

Wonderful news! <delay20 /><anim id="BigSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />This year
is the Year of the Rooster!
<anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It doesn't matter whether you're
wise as an owl, silly as a goose,
or graceful as a swan<tag a="110" b="0" />
<anim id="HappyDance" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I say this is a time for birds of a

again.<delay20 /> <anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I can't believe it only comes
once every 12 years!<pageBreak /><anim id="Negative" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Well,<delay frames="13" /> no need to give me any special
treatment.<delay20 /> That is<tag a="110" b="0" /><delay frames="13" /><anim id="Grin" target="actor" targetSpec="" />unless you really
feel you must, <tag a="110" b="6" />.</message>
	<message label="010" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="FaintSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I can't help but feel this year is
going to be an especially good
one for me.
Why, <anim id="Aha" target="actor" targetSpec="" />just look at my snout!<delay frames="40" />
<anim id="SmugFace" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It is positively aglow with the
possibilities already, <tag a="110" b="6" />!</message>
