<anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />But while I had to let that handsome

<anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />No matter how handsome a table is,<delay frames="13" /><anim id="SmugFace" target="actor" targetSpec="" />
if it doesn't complement your style,

a chair that was both solidly built

<anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I had no choice but to let it go.<delay20 />
<anim id="Greeting" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Still,<delay8 /> that chair taught me
