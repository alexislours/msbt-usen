That shovel you were holding
comes in handy, doesn't it?
<anim id="FaintSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />You aren't the only one who knows
their way around a shovel.<delay20 /><anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> I myself
dig for hot springs on occasion.
<anim id="Negative" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I can't say I've had much success,<delay8 />

<anim id="FaintSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />That umbrella is the perfect

Why, <anim id="HappyFlower" target="actor" targetSpec="" />that's lovely!<delay frames="13" /> Waterways add so much to our island's natural beauty.

bug hunting, huh?
<anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I haven't caught bugs since I was a
little girl,<delay8 /> but I do remember a few
best practices.
<anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Remember to always approach ever

must.<delay20 /> Otherwise, they'll fly away.
<anim id="Greeting" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Good luck out there, <tag a="110" b="5" />!</message>
	<message label="101" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="HappyDance" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Isn't it just the best feeling

meaning to chat with you.<delay20 /> I could 
use a few bug-catching pointers.
Well,<delay8 /> unless your advice is
"Practice makes perfect."<delay20 />
<anim id="Laughing" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I already knew that,<delay8 /> <tag a="110" b="5" />.</message>
	<message label="104" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Grin" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I heard a rumor about you,<delay8 />
<tag a="110" b="3" /><tag a="110" b="0" /> Is it true you
finished catching every single bug?!
<anim id="Aha" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I had no idea I was in the presence

Big ones?<delay frames="13" /> Small ones?<delay frames="13" /> Rare ones?<delay20 />

Oh dear,<delay frames="13" /><anim id="Laughing" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> now I want to go

	<message label="106" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Negative" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Don't be discouraged if the fish
aren't biting.<delay20 /> Sometimes it's just
a matter of location.
<anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />You need to keep moving around
until you spot a shadow in the water.<delay20 />
Fishing requires true perseverance! 
<tag a="110" b="0" />And a surprising amount of
walking,<delay8 /> <anim id="Laughing" target="actor" targetSpec="" />so don't forget to wear
comfortable shoes,<delay8 /> <tag a="110" b="5" />!</message>
	<message label="107" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00">I know fishing can be boring,<delay8 />
<anim id="FaintSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />but your biggest catches will

Plus, if no one is looking,<delay8 /> you can

to teach me,<delay8 /> <tag a="110" b="5" />!</message>
