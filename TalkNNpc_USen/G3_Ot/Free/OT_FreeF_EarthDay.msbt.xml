are truly stylish plants.<delay20 /><anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> They grow
with such confidence!
<anim id="FaintSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Since we're in the midst of Nature
Day celebrations, <delay20 /><anim id="Greeting" target="actor" targetSpec="" />why not pick up a
seedling and see for yourself?
<anim id="HappyFlower" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It's good for the planet AND good for
your home-decor reputation.<delay frames="40" /> <anim id="Serious" target="actor" targetSpec="" />And
both are very important, my dear!</message>

know that shrubs can grow one right
next to the other without any gaps?
<anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It's the perfect way to make a
hedge wall around your home!<pageBreak /><anim id="HappyFlower" target="actor" targetSpec="" />A hedge around a home is like a
gorgeous green wall around a castle,
don't you think?
<anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Though<tag a="110" b="0" />I suppose it wouldn't keep
dragons out now would it,

in your hair is ALL the rage right
now? <delay20 /><anim id="BigSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It's true, darling!
<anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />You know, <colour id="3" /><delay8 />Leif<colour id="65535" /> sells some rare
flowers that could be turned into
a gorgeous crown.
<anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />You should give it a try. <delay frames="40" /><anim id="HappyFlower" target="actor" targetSpec="" />You'll look
flower fabulous, <tag a="110" b="6" />!</message>
	<message label="004" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Worried" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Have you ever had your flowers
trampled by someone who wasn't
looking where they were going?
<anim id="Angry" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Well, I have, and it's simply awful!<pageBreak /><anim id="Serious" target="actor" targetSpec="" />And that's why it's never a bad idea
to build a sturdy fence around one's
flower beds.
It not only protects your gorgeous
flowers from careless stompers,<delay20 /><anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> it
also looks rather stylish.</message>

look SO much more beautiful,<delay8 /> they
purify the very air we breathe!
<anim id="Hesitate" target="actor" targetSpec="" />We owe them so much, <delay8 />I almost feel
bad complaining about the ones that
make me<tag a="110" b="0" /><delay20 /><anim id="Sneezing" target="actor" targetSpec="" />sneeze.<delay frames="45" /> <anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Almost.</message>
