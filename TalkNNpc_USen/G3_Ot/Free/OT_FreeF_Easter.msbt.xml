the island today.<delay frames="40" /><anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> It is Bunny Day
after all, <tag a="110" b="6" />.
<anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />You know, <delay8 />Bunny Day eggs are quite
fashion forward, what with their bold
colors and audacious patterns.
<anim id="Greeting" target="actor" targetSpec="" />They're a fabulous DIY material too.<delay frames="40" />
<anim id="Serious" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Goodness, <delay8 />I do hope you're scooping
them up whenever you can, darling.</message>
	<message label="002" attrib="00 00 00 26 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />If I'm not mistaken, that funny bunny
<colour id="3" />Zipper <colour id="65535" />is hippity hopping about the
plaza as we speak.
<anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />One couldn't miss the telltale sounds
of exuberance wafting on the wind if
one tried.
<anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Anyhoo, <delay8 />I understand he prepared
lots of candy eggs and egg recipes
for the occasion.
<anim id="Greeting" target="actor" targetSpec="" />He may be an<tag a="110" b="0" /><delay8 />unusual fellow<tag a="110" b="0" /><delay20 /><anim id="Grin" target="actor" targetSpec="" />but
he certainly takes his job very
seriously, <tag a="110" b="6" />.</message>
	<message label="003" attrib="00 00 00 26 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I admit, there's something about
Bunny Day that puts a bounce in
my step.
<anim id="HappyFlower" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It must be seeing all those eggs
dressed up in their most stylish
attire, <tag a="110" b="6" />!</message>
	<message label="100" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00">Believe you me, darling, <anim id="Negative" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I do NOT like
to go around spreading rumors<tag a="110" b="0" /><delay20 />but<delay8 />
<anim id="HappyDance" target="actor" targetSpec="" />you won't believe the rumor I heard!
<anim id="Hesitate" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I heard that something strange is
happening when you take an island
tour with a <colour id="1" /><tag a="50" b="0" arg="0x100 0xcd03" />Nook Miles Ticket<colour id="65535" /><tag a="110" b="0" />
I heard<tag a="110" b="0" /><anim id="Serious" target="actor" targetSpec="" />that eggs<tag a="110" b="0" /><delay8 />are coming out
of the rocks on those islands.<delay20 />
<anim id="Shocked" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Eggs, darling! <delay8 />From ROCKS!
<anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />And quite a few of them too, if 
you can believe it!<pageBreak />You know what else I heard?<delay20 /><anim id="Serious" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> I heard
the phenomenon might be happening
on other islands too.
<anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Perhaps it's happening right here on
this very island?<delay frames="40" /><anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> You really ought to
look into it, <tag a="110" b="6" />.</message>
	<message label="101" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="QuestionMark" target="actor" targetSpec="" />You know that old saying, "You can
catch more flies with honey"?<pageBreak />Well, <tag a="110" b="3" /> darling,<delay20 /><anim id="FaintSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />
there's an old Bunny Day saying
you should also know.
<anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It goes,<delay20 /> "You can find more eggs by
hitting coconut trees."<pageBreak /><anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I know, I know. <delay20 />These old sayings can
be a bit strange.<delay20 /> <anim id="Negative" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Still, one should not
ignore their wisdom, <tag a="110" b="6" />.
Though I admit,<delay8 /><anim id="Grin" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> I'd rather get eggs
from coconut trees than flies from
honey any ol' day.</message>

this year, <delay20 />is it not?<delay40 /><anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> Well, I for one
can hardly wait!
<anim id="AbsentMindedness" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I love having an excuse to go
gallivanting about the island
hunting for colorful candy eggs.
<anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Of course,<delay8 /><anim id="HappyDance" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> I also love having an
excuse to EAT all those colorful
candy eggs, <tag a="110" b="6" />.</message>

but have you heard the latest
talk about these Bunny Day eggs?<pageBreak /><anim id="Eh" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Well!<delay20 /> There's never a completely
reliable way to discern fish from
eggs when you only see a shadow<tag a="110" b="0" />
<anim id="SmugFace" target="actor" targetSpec="" />But word around the island is that
eggs always have medium-sized
shadows. <delay20 /><anim id="Serious" target="actor" targetSpec="" />You didn't hear it from me!</message>
