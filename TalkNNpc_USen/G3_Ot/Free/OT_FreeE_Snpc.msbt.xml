I have sensed some sort of<tag a="110" b="0" />
presence<tag a="110" b="0" />on the island.
<anim id="AbsentMindedness" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I am quite sensitive to such things,
you know,<delay8 /> and I tell you, <delay20 />this strange

<anim id="Shocked" target="actor" targetSpec="" />There's nothing there!

Someone washed up on the shore!<delay frames="40" />
<anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />We do seem to get a lot of that here.
<anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />This fellow looks different from the
