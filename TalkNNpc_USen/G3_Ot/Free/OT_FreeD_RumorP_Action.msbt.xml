<anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />did some EXTERIOR decorating!
<anim id="Grin" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Well, aren't you on the
cutting edge, <tag a="110" b="6" />.<pageBreak /><anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Arranging furniture in the great
outdoors is ALL the rage, I tell you.<delay20 />
<anim id="SmugFace" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I have plans to dabble in it myself.</message>

you earned some ridiculous
number of Nook Miles yesterday!
<anim id="HappyFlower" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It's just SO satisfying to save up
those miles, isn't it?<delay20 /><anim id="Grin" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> I suppose
I best get on it myself, <tag a="110" b="6" />!</message>

<colour id="65535" />quite a few times yesterday, my dear.<pageBreak /><anim id="QuestionMark" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Did something catch your eye?<delay20 />
<anim id="Serious" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Were you having a hard time
deciding whether to buy it?
<anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I know the feeling. I really do.<delay frames="40" />
<anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />But just remember my motto<tag a="110" b="0" /><pageBreak /><anim id="Greeting" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It is far better to regret the things
you have bought<delay frames="40" /><anim id="WrySmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> than to regret
not buying the things you wanted.</message>
	<message label="141" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00">Yesterday <delay8 /><anim id="QuestionMark" target="actor" targetSpec="" />you set the island tune
to something new, yes?<delay frames="40" /><anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> It certainly
caught everyone's attention.
<anim id="Aha" target="actor" targetSpec="" />And it was your creation?!<delay frames="40" />
<anim id="HappyDance" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Your ear for musical composition
is VERY impressive, <tag a="110" b="6" />.</message>
	<message label="142" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Aha" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Why, <tag a="110" b="3" />!<delay frames="30" /><anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> The change
you made to the <colour id="1" />Resident Services
<colour id="65535" />flag design yesterday was superb.
<anim id="Clapping" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Talk about eye-catching!<delay frames="13" /> Very YOU!<delay frames="40" />
Yes, <anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I'd say you have a bright future
in flag design, <tag a="110" b="6" />.</message>
	<message label="143" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Well, well! Someone had fun
yesterday using a wand to make all
of their fashion dreams come true.
<anim id="FaintSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Oh, don't give me that innocent look.
I heard all about it, <tag a="110" b="6" />.<pageBreak /><anim id="HappyFlower" target="actor" targetSpec="" />You have to admit, that tool is an
absolute dream when it comes to
trying on all the latest fashions.</message>
	<message label="144" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Eh" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I heard you were jumping back and
forth over rivers yesterday using
that <tag a="50" b="0" arg="0x100 0xcd03" />vaulting pole of yours.
<anim id="Negative" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I confess, <delay frames="13" />it looks just terrifying
to me, <tag a="110" b="6" />! <delay20 /><anim id="Worried" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Honestly, I'm
not sure what scares me more<tag a="110" b="0" />
<anim id="Confused" target="actor" targetSpec="" />messing up my hair as I vault
through the air<tag a="110" b="0" /><delay frames="40" /><anim id="Crying" target="actor" targetSpec="" />or messing up my
makeup when I land<anim id="Eh" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> in the water.</message>
	<message label="145" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00">Well, well, <tag a="110" b="3" />,<delay frames="13" /><anim id="Worried" target="actor" targetSpec="" />
I heard you bought quite a few
turnips from li'l <colour id="3" />Daisy Mae <colour id="65535" />yesterday.
<anim id="Serious" target="actor" targetSpec="" />One must be careful with fresh
turnips.<delay frames="40" /> <anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Hold on to them too long
and they'll rot before you know it!</message>
	<message label="146" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Hesitate" target="actor" targetSpec="" />So, <delay frames="13" />I heard you sold some turnips
you bought for a VERY high price.<pageBreak /><anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I'm impressed by your timing.<delay frames="40" />
So, if you have any hot stalk-market
tips,<delay frames="13" /><anim id="Grin" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> I'm ALL ears, <tag a="110" b="6" />.</message>
	<message label="147" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I'm sorry, but I couldn't help but
notice how chatty you were the
other day, <tag a="110" b="6" />.
<anim id="Eh" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It was SO unlike you. <delay frames="40" /><anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />You tend
to do the listening while others
do the talking.
<anim id="Greeting" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Well, <delay frames="13" />good for you. <delay20 /><anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It must have
been nice to make folks listen to
YOU for a change.</message>
	<message label="148" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I hear you were quite gung ho with
the weeding yesterday.<pageBreak />I'll have you know,<delay frames="13" /><anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> I have a great
deal of respect for those of you
who pull weeds around here.
<anim id="Hesitate" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It says a lot about one's character
when one is willing to do that sort
of hard work for the benefit of all.</message>
	<message label="149" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="FaintSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I know you've been experimenting

want to say<tag a="110" b="0" /><delay20 /><anim id="Clapping" target="actor" targetSpec="" />BRAVO!<delay frames="40" /><anim id="FaintSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />
<anim id="HappyDance" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Trying out a new look is so
exciting<tag a="110" b="0" />and so daring!<delay frames="40" /><anim id="Sighing" target="actor" targetSpec="" />
If only I were so brave.
Alas,<delay frames="13" /><anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> I just keep going back to the

different today.<delay20 /><anim id="QuestionMark" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> Perhaps I'm just
imagining things?
<anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Either way, <delay frames="13" />you are quite mysterious,
aren't you?<delay20 /> I mean,<delay frames="13" /><anim id="Restless" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> the way you
change your look with such ease<tag a="110" b="0" />
<anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I can't help but wonder<tag a="110" b="0" /><delay20 /><anim id="Serious" target="actor" targetSpec="" />did you
come to this island to change
your identity and hide out?!
<anim id="Laughing" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Hahaha! <delay20 />I kid, darling.<delay frames="13" /> I KID!<delay frames="50" />

a shutterbug you were yesterday.<pageBreak /><anim id="QuestionMark" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Did you take any good photographs?<delay frames="40" />
<anim id="Blushing" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Did you take any of<tag a="110" b="0" /><delay20 />little ol' me?<pageBreak /><anim id="Serious" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Do tell me when you're going to snap
my photo.<delay frames="40" /><anim id="SmugFace" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> I must make sure you get

	<message label="153" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Rumor has it you were catching sea
creatures left and right yesterday.<pageBreak /><anim id="Grin" target="actor" targetSpec="" />One might have mistaken you for a
mermaid, I hear!<pageBreak /><anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Being a good diver is a good skill for
an island dweller to have, I suppose.<delay frames="40" />
