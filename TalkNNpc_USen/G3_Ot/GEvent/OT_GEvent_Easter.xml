<tag a="110" b="6" />?<pageBreak /><anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I mean,<delay8 /> it's a holiday that gives us

candy as possible!<delay frames="40" /><anim id="Aha" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> Guilt-free!
<anim id="Grin" target="actor" targetSpec="" />What's NOT to love, darling?</message>

been to visit <colour id="3" />Zipper<colour id="65535" /> yet?<pageBreak /><anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />That bouncing bunny is certainly
doing his darndest to make Bunny
Day fabulous for everyone.
<anim id="Greeting" target="actor" targetSpec="" />But my goodness,<delay8 /> the energy he puts
into it.<delay20 /> <anim id="Eh" target="actor" targetSpec="" />So much hippity!<delay8 /> So much
hoppity! <delay frames="40" /><anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />How DOES he do it?
I tell you darling, <anim id="Sleepy" target="actor" targetSpec="" />just watching him

know that Bunny Day eggs are
edible?
<anim id="HappyFlower" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It's true! It's true!<delay20 /> They're made out
of candy, <tag a="110" b="6" />!<pageBreak /><anim id="Serious" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Yes,<delay8 /> it is a shame to break their
pretty shells<tag a="110" b="0" /><delay20 /><anim id="Laughing" target="actor" targetSpec="" />but if they taste as

balloons floating through the air.<delay20 />
<anim id="QuestionMark" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Are there more today than usual?
I keep hoping they might float down
to the ground<tag a="110" b="0" /><anim id="Sighing" target="actor" targetSpec="" />but they always
remain out of reach, <tag a="110" b="6" />.
<anim id="Angry" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Ugh!<delay8 /> It's like they're taunting me!<delay frames="40" />
<anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />There MUST be some way to bring
them down<tag a="110" b="0" /></message>

a moment ago.<delay frames="30" /> <anim id="HappyFlower" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I tell you, it was
adorable!
<anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I wonder who might have sent it,
<tag a="110" b="6" />?<delay frames="40" /><anim id="Negative" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> It wasn't like the
others.
<anim id="Greeting" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Ah well, I'm sure some lucky
beachcomber will find out.<delay20 />
<anim id="Grin" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Perhaps it'll be you, darling.</message>

Bunny Day on the brain.<pageBreak /><anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Even some of the balloons flying
over the island are starting to look
like eggs to me.
<anim id="AbsentMindedness" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Mmm<delay8 />, I wonder if they are edible
as well<tag a="110" b="0" /><pageBreak /><anim id="Surprised" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Oh no, now I'm craving delicious

<anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />So there I was,<delay8 /> looking up at a tree
when I spotted this strange fruit<tag a="110" b="0" />
<anim id="Greeting" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Needless to say, <delay8 />I gave the tree a
good shake<tag a="110" b="0" /><delay20 /><anim id="Shocked" target="actor" targetSpec="" />and that's when an egg
fell out! A brightly colored egg!
I was quite startled, of course.<delay8 />
I mean,<delay8 /><anim id="Oops" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> it nearly conked me right
on the head!
<anim id="Eh" target="actor" targetSpec="" />What if it had been a rock or
something?!<delay frames="40" /> <anim id="Confused" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I might have ended up
with a goose egg on my head!
<anim id="Negative" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Eggs falling from trees<tag a="110" b="0" /><delay8 />eggs on my
head<tag a="110" b="0" /><delay frames="40" />  <anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Long story short,<delay8 /> eggs are
turning up in the strangest places!</message>

bit of fishing a moment ago and
you'll never guess what I reeled in!
<anim id="Negative" target="actor" targetSpec="" />No!<delay20 /> Not a fish, silly!<delay20 /> <anim id="Shocked" target="actor" targetSpec="" />An EGG!<pageBreak /><anim id="QuestionMark" target="actor" targetSpec="" />What kind of egg could it possibly
be?!<delay frames="40" /> <anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It's much too large to be a fish
egg, and much too colorful as well<tag a="110" b="0" />
<anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Oh dear,<delay8 /> I do love a good mystery,
<tag a="110" b="6" />!</message>
