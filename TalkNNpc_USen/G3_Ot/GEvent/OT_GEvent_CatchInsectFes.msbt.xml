if the bugs we're about to catch are
as nervous as I am?</message>
	<message label="002" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Today is the Bug-Off,<delay8 /> and that means
you and I will be rivals.<delay20 /><anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> We will be
civilized about it, won't we,<delay8 /> darling?</message>
	<message label="003" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Greeting" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I understand the Bug-Off starts at
9:00 AM today.<delay20 /> Surely you'll join?<delay20 />
<anim id="FaintSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It wouldn't be the same without you.</message>
	<message label="004" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />The Bug-Off is a serious competition,
my dear!<delay20 /> <anim id="SmugFace" target="actor" targetSpec="" />We must put our best nets
forward today!</message>

the bugs don't seem to mind.<delay20 /><anim id="Eh" target="actor" targetSpec="" />
They're buzzing about like crazy!
<anim id="SmugFace" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I suppose we'll just have to keep our
cool and try to keep up!</message>
	<message label="006" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Sighing" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Good grief!<delay8 /> I just scared off a bug at
the last second.<delay frames="40" /> <anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Ah well,<delay8 /> I suppose I
shouldn't let it<tag a="110" b="0" /><anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />bug me!<delay8 /> Haha!</message>
	<message label="007" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Aha" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Who knew that bug catching was
so much fun?! <delay20 /><anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I tell you, <delay8 />the next
Bug-Off can't come soon enough!</message>
	<message label="008" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="HappyDance" target="actor" targetSpec="" />That Bug-Off was simply wonderful!<delay20 />
<anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />But after swinging that net around<tag a="110" b="0" /><anim id="Sighing" target="actor" targetSpec="" />
my arms are as limp as noodles!
<anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Hmmm. <delay8 />Yes. <delay8 />What I need now is
some pampering.<delay20 /> <anim id="Grin" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I think a massage
will do nicely.</message>
	<message label="009" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Well, the Bug-Off certainly was
quite a lot of commotion today,<delay20 />
wouldn't you say?
<anim id="Sighing" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Are you as exhausted as I am?<pageBreak /><anim id="Greeting" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I, for one, <delay8 />can't wait to get home and
fall into bed.<delay20 /><anim id="HappyFlower" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> I'll sleep snug as a bug
in a rug.<delay8 /> Haha!</message>
	<message label="010" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Confused" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It gives me such a fright when bugs
suddenly flitter out of the shadows!<delay20 />
<anim id="Sighing" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I get so flustered that I miss them!
<anim id="Negative" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I know it's silly.<delay20 /> I'm so big and
they're so teensy<tag a="110" b="0" /> <anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />What could they
possibly do to me?<delay frames="40" /> <anim id="Angry" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Still<tag a="110" b="0" />ick!</message>
	<message label="011" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />You know,<delay8 /> going after bugs that
you find easy to catch can be a
winning strategy.
<anim id="Greeting" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Even if you catch the same kind of
bug, the amount counts. <delay20 /><anim id="FaintSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />So catch
as many as you like, my dear.</message>
	<message label="012" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Restless" target="actor" targetSpec="" />You know, <delay8 />I catch all kinds of bugs
during my day-to-day life and don't
give it a second thought.
<anim id="Serious" target="actor" targetSpec="" />And yet, <delay8 />I get terribly tense during
the Bug-Off!<delay20 /><anim id="FaintSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> I suppose it's just my
competitive streak kicking in.</message>
	<message label="013" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I've been trying to decide what the
best strategy is when it comes to
winning the Bug-Off.
<anim id="HappyDance" target="actor" targetSpec="" />And I've finally figured it out,
my dear!<delay frames="40" /> <anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />The best strategy is<tag a="110" b="0" /><pageBreak /><anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />don't waste your time thinking about
strategy,<delay frames="13" /> just swing your net at as
many bugs as you can.<delay20 /> <anim id="Laughing" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Haha!<delay frames="50" /><anim id="FaintSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" /></message>
	<message label="104" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="AbsentMindedness" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Ahhh, Bug-Off season has finally
arrived!<delay20 /> Isn't it wonderful?<pageBreak /><anim id="Eh" target="actor" targetSpec="" />My plan this time?<delay frames="40" /> Why, I shall <anim id="Dance" target="actor" targetSpec="" />dance
like a butterfly<tag a="110" b="0" /><delay frames="60" /><anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />and catch like a bee!<pageBreak /><anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Or, <delay8 />you know,<delay20 /> something like that.
<delay frames="40" /><anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />My point being,<delay8 /> I shall pursue those
bugs with grace and elegance.
<anim id="Negative" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Remember,<delay8 /> it's not just whether you
win or loseâ€”<anim id="SmugFace" target="actor" targetSpec="" />it's how you look while
playing the game, <tag a="110" b="6" />!</message>
	<message label="105" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00">I must say,<delay8 /><anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> I feel quite certain I'm
going to have no problem catching
one bug after another.
Not only am I VERY persistent,<delay20 /><anim id="Scheming" target="actor" targetSpec="" />
I may or may not have a secret
weapon at my disposal!
Don't tell anyone,<delay20 /><anim id="Blushing" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> but I'm almost
certain the perfume I'm wearing<tag a="110" b="0" />
um<tag a="110" b="0" />attracts bugs.
<anim id="Negative" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It's not exactly what I was going for
when I put it on,<delay20 /><anim id="Laughing" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> but I'll take any
edge I can get, <tag a="110" b="6" />!</message>

truly be fall, I suppose.<delay frames="40" /> <anim id="WrySmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It's a tad
bittersweet, don't you think?
Well, <anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />at least I get to close out the
