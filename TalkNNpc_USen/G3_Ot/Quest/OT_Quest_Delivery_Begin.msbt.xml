from someone and held onto it for
just a little too long?
<anim id="Hesitate" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Well, it's embarrassing, but I've
held onto an item that belongs to
<tag a="115" b="1" arg="0xcd00" /> for ages.</message>
	<message label="001_a" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Want me to return it?</message>
	<message label="001_b" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />You could apologize.</message>

over at my place recently, and
<gender3 m="he" f="she" /> left a small item behind<tag a="110" b="0" />
<anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I'm not sure <gender3 m="he" f="she" /> even knows it's
missing, and it's been a little while
now, to be honest.</message>
	<message label="002_a" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I could return it!</message>

	<message label="003" attrib="00 00 02 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Angry" target="actor" targetSpec="" />This is unbelievable.<delay20 /> I just received
a package that's addressed to
<tag a="115" b="1" arg="0xcd00" /> instead of me.
<anim id="Negative" target="actor" targetSpec="" />The post office is not exempt from
providing excellent customer service,
if you ask me!
<anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I'll suppose I'll have to deliver
this one myself<tag a="110" b="0" /></message>

Oh, that would be such a help.<pageBreak /><anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Of course, I'll still need to go
apologize in person, and perhaps
send a card too.
<anim id="Serious" target="actor" targetSpec="" />No one outdoes <tag a="110" b="10" />
when it comes to manners.<delay20 />
<anim id="Negative" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Just let them try.</message>
	<message label="005" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Eh" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Oh, would you really? <delay20 />That would
be wonderfully helpful.<pageBreak /><anim id="Negative" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I hate to think of poor
<tag a="115" b="1" arg="0xcd00" /> wondering
where <gender3 m="his" f="her" /> item went.

<anim id="Grin" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Well, if you insist! <delay20 />Here is the
package to be delivered.</message>
	<message label="007" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Worried" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Yes, I suppose that's probably best,
even though it makes me look a
bit foolish.
<anim id="Sighing" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Thanks for nudging me to do the
right thing, <tag a="110" b="3" />.</message>

sufficiently outraged! <delay20 />I'm sure
<tag a="115" b="1" arg="0xcd00" /> would be!
<anim id="Assent" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Well.<delay20 /> I suppose I'll have to take
matters into my own hands and
deliver it myself.</message>

<anim id="Aha" target="actor" targetSpec="" />For <tag a="115" b="1" arg="0xcd00" />!<pageBreak /><anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />The only thing is<tag a="110" b="0" />it's a bit gauche

So<tag a="110" b="0" /><anim id="QuestionMark" target="actor" targetSpec="" />would you do it for me?</message>

I said something "incredibly cruel,"
