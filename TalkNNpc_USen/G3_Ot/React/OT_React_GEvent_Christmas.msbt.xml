yesterday for all of your hard work,
delivering for Santa.
<anim id="QuestionMark" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Did you know that my gift from him
was an actual toy?<delay40 /> <anim id="Laughing" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It was adorable!<delay40 />
And obviously perfect for Toy Day.
<anim id="FaintSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It's also proof from one who knows
that toys are for EVERYONE, <delay20 />not
just children, <tag a="110" b="6" />.</message>
	<message label="001_02" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Hello" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Since you were nice enough to
deliver my gift from Santa yesterday,<delay20 />
I thought I might tell you about it!
<anim id="BigSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It was an actual toy,<delay20 /> presumably
made in the workshop by genuine
elves, <tag a="110" b="6" />!
<anim id="HappyFlower" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Let me tell you, I was giddy as a
school<tag a="110" b="15" />, darling!<10_4 /><anim id="Cheering" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> Elf toys!</message>

yesterday.<delay20 /> It meant the world to me.<pageBreak /><anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I hope you enjoyed my gift to you
just as much—<delay20 /><anim id="Love" target="actor" targetSpec="" />it came from the
heart, darling.
<anim id="Laughing" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Well, <delay20 />the heart AND the wallet,<delay20 /> to be
quite honest,<delay20 /> but that's part of the
fun, <tag a="110" b="6" />!</message>

with you yesterday! <delay40 /><anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Thank you
again, <tag a="110" b="6" />.
<anim id="Love" target="actor" targetSpec="" />How lovely to have made such dear
friends in rather a short time, <delay20 /><anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />when
you really think about it.
<anim id="AbsentMindedness" target="actor" targetSpec="" />A tourism board would advertise us
as "<tag a="110" b="9" />, <delay20 />where your
future best friend already lives."</message>

delivering gifts all day yesterday, are
you exhausted today, <tag a="110" b="6" />?
<anim id="Eh" target="actor" targetSpec="" />No, <delay20 />you look like your usual, <delay20 />chipper
self!<delay40 /> I'm in awe, darling!<delay40 /><anim id="Laughing" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> I'm also in
"awwwww" because you're adorable!

precious toy you delivered<tag a="110" b="0" /><delay40 /> <anim id="Love" target="actor" targetSpec="" />What a
perfect Toy Day, <tag a="110" b="6" />.

night.<delay40 /><anim id="AbsentMindedness" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> His white beard was SO
elegantly trimmed and coiffed.
I know it was just a dream,<delay20 /><anim id="Love" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> but it
was still a lovely way to spend Toy
Day.<delay40 /><anim id="Laughing" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> I recommend it, <tag a="110" b="6" />.</message>
