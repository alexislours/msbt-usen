the library<delay20 /> when I found a note
<anim id="Serious" target="actor" targetSpec="" />sandwiched in between the pages!</message>

It was the name of a suspect in the
novel.<delay frames="30" /> <anim id="Frantic" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Was he the one who did it?</message>

<anim id="Grin" target="actor" targetSpec="" />So I wrote my own name<delay20 /> and stuck
it in the book instead,<delay20 /> <tag a="110" b="5" />!</message>
	<message label="006" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Pardon" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I wasn't sure I believed it,<delay20 /> so I kept
reading the rest of the book.<delay40 /> <anim id="SadSpiral" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Turned
out the note was true,<delay20 /> <tag a="110" b="5" />.</message>
	<message label="007" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />In the story,<delay20 /> characters were passing
secret messages they'd put inside of
a book,<delay20 /> <anim id="Pardon" target="actor" targetSpec="" />so this got my attention<delay8 /><tag a="110" b="0" />
<anim id="Hesitate" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I know it sounds silly now,<delay20 /> but I was
disappointed that all I'd found<anim id="Worried" target="actor" targetSpec="" /><delay20 /> was
someone's to-do list,<delay20 /> <tag a="110" b="5" />.</message>
	<message label="008" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I read the note.<delay20 /> It said, "Balloons
won't break from a mosquito bite."<delay frames="30" />
<anim id="Pardon" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Seriously weird,<delay20 /> <tag a="110" b="5" />.
<anim id="Worried" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I got so caught up in wondering why
someone would write that,<delay20 /> I <anim id="Negative" target="actor" targetSpec="" />couldn't
concentrate on my book anymore.</message>
	<message label="009" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Pardon" target="actor" targetSpec="" />The note read,<delay20 /> "Penguins don't get
frostbite."<delay frames="40" /> <anim id="Aha" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Was that true?<delay40 /> I felt like
I should know,<delay20 /> <tag a="110" b="5" /><delay8 /><tag a="110" b="0" /><pageBreak /><anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I asked <tag a="110" b="11" arg="0xcd00" />,<delay20 /> who was
sitting right by me.<pageBreak /><anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Neither of us knew,<delay20 /> <anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />but we decided

I can't resist.<delay40 /> <anim id="Worried" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It's kind of a problem<delay8 /><tag a="110" b="0" /></message>

get tired of eating <tag a="110" b="7" arg="0xcd01" /><delay8 /><tag a="110" b="0" />
<anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />That's why I want to try my idea for
a fortune-telling <tag a="110" b="7" arg="0xcd00" /> cake,<delay20 /> <anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />with

<anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />You'll have to come over and try
some,<delay20 /> <anim id="WrySmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />assuming I can make my

<anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Crafting just suits me,<delay20 /> somehow<delay8 /><tag a="110" b="0" />

<anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I made a simple coaster,<delay20 /> and it came

<anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />For me,<delay20 /> there was that one special

<anim id="AbsentMindedness" target="actor" targetSpec="" />The softness of the graphite in that
