I made a checklist to prepare for
today's big Fishing Tourney.
<anim id="AbsentMindedness" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Step one:<delay20 /> find and talk to <colour id="3" />C.J.<colour id="65535" /><delay40 />
Step two:<delay20 /> catch lots of fishies.<delay40 />
<anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Step three:<delay20 /> humbly accept prize.
<anim id="Restless" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Unfortunately,<delay20 /> I couldn't make
myself believe<delay20 /> that I was going
to <anim id="Sighing" target="actor" targetSpec="" />make it past step one.</message>
