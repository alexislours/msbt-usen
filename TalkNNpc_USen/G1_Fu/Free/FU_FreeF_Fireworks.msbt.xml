but it's finally here! <delay20 /><anim id="Cheering" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I'm talking about
today's fireworks show, of course.
<anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I still have a little bit of time before it
starts at 7 PM. <delay20 />Hmm<tag a="110" b="0" /><pageBreak /><anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Maybe I should just work on my
<tag a="135" b="4" arg="0xcd00" /> inspired crochet project
to keep myself busy in the meantime.</message>
	<message label="002" attrib="00 00 00 28 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Love" target="actor" targetSpec="" />There's something about there being
a stall in the plaza that adds an extra
level of excitement to an event.
<anim id="BigSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Not to mention the raffle! <delay20 /><anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I hear it
doesn't start until 7,<delay8 /> but I've already
got a feeling we'll both be winners.<anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" /></message>
	<message label="003" attrib="00 00 00 28 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />The weather's supposed to be nice
and clear for tonight's fireworks
show.<delay20 /><anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> What a relief, <tag a="110" b="5" />!
<anim id="AbsentMindedness" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Giant flowers of light blossoming
against the night sky<tag a="110" b="0" /><delay20 /><anim id="Love" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> It's going to
be beyond magical.</message>
	<message label="004" attrib="00 00 00 27 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Hesitate" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It's almost time for the fireworks
show to start.<delay20 /><anim id="Worried" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> I'm getting so antsy!<pageBreak /><anim id="IdeaBulb" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Maybe you can help distract me.<delay20 />
<anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Let's talk about something else.<pageBreak />Have you had a chance to read
<tag a="135" b="0" arg="0xcd00" />?<pageBreak /><anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It's a true work of art. <delay20 /><anim id="AbsentMindedness" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Much like the
works of fire we're about to see<tag a="110" b="0" /><delay20 />
<anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Oh, it's no use, <tag a="110" b="5" />.</message>
	<message label="005" attrib="00 00 00 27 00 00 00 00"><anim id="AbsentMindedness" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I love that rush of anticipation and
adrenaline that you feel right before
a fireworks show begins. <delay8 />Don't you?
<anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It's like cutting into a freshly baked
cake, <tag a="110" b="5" />.<pageBreak /><anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />No matter how many times you've
made it before, <delay8 />you're never sure
what to expect. <delay20 /><anim id="Cheering" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It's so exhilarating!</message>
	<message label="006" attrib="00 00 00 27 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Aha" target="actor" targetSpec="" />We're only a few minutes away from
a sky full of fireworks. <delay20 /><delay20 />I can't wait to
see what made it into the show.
<anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I like watching the traditional
fireworks, <delay8 /><anim id="Love" target="actor" targetSpec="" />but the more unique and
eccentric ones always steal the show.</message>
	<message label="007" attrib="00 00 00 26 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Silent" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It always seems quieter than usual
after a fireworks show, <tag a="110" b="5" />.<pageBreak /><anim id="AbsentMindedness" target="actor" targetSpec="" />But if I close my eyes, <delay8 />I can still see
the sky alight with all those beautiful
and brilliant designs.</message>
	<message label="008" attrib="00 00 00 26 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Love" target="actor" targetSpec="" />That fireworks show was one of the
best I've ever seen!<pageBreak /><anim id="AbsentMindedness" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I can still feel and hear the sound of
each firework bursting into the sky!<delay20 />
<anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />In fact,<delay8 /><anim id="Eh" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> I can't hear much else.
<anim id="QuestionMark" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Did you say something just now?</message>
	<message label="009" attrib="00 00 00 26 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Worried" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I always feel a little empty inside
after the last of the fireworks have
gone off, <tag a="110" b="5" />.
<anim id="HappyFlower" target="actor" targetSpec="" />But just talking to you has already
started to make me feel better.</message>
	<message label="010" attrib="00 00 00 29 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Well, that's it for this year's
fireworks! <delay20 /><anim id="AbsentMindedness" target="actor" targetSpec="" />And what a glorious
season it was, <tag a="110" b="5" /><tag a="110" b="0" />
<anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I hope next year I'm still living on
<tag a="110" b="8" /> so I can compile
a detailed comparison.</message>
	<message label="011" attrib="00 00 00 29 00 00 00 00">The shows may be over, <anim id="HappyFlower" target="actor" targetSpec="" />but the joy
of watching the <tag a="90" b="27" /> fireworks with
you will never be forgotten!
<anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I already can't wait for next year's
offerings. <delay20 /><anim id="Grin" target="actor" targetSpec="" />They've got big skies to
fill, that's for sure!</message>
	<message label="012" attrib="00 00 00 29 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Love" target="actor" targetSpec="" />That last fireworks show was such a
lovely close to the season.<delay20 /> <anim id="Hesitate" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I know
I should be kind of sad, but<tag a="110" b="0" /><pageBreak /><anim id="HappyDance" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Now I'm full of excitement for what
the future might bring, <tag a="110" b="5" />.</message>
