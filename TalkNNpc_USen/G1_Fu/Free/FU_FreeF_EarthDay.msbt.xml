<anim id="Sighing" target="actor" targetSpec="" />He's always hopping from island to
island,<delay8 /> selling seeds and plants.
<anim id="Eh" target="actor" targetSpec="" />That said,<delay20 /><anim id="FaintSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> I'm grateful every time he
stops on this island.<pageBreak />When I've got shrub fever, <anim id="BigSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" /><delay20 />he's the
only one who's got the cure!</message>

colors next to each other,<delay20 /> you could
end up with a hybrid blossom.
<anim id="Love" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I love when gardening can become a
little science experiment in your own
backyard, <tag a="110" b="5" />.</message>

flowers to wear in your hair or
brighten up your home.
<anim id="Eh" target="actor" targetSpec="" />But then again,<delay20 /> it's Nature Day,<delay20 />
<anim id="Oops" target="actor" targetSpec="" />so maybe I should just leave the
beautiful blossoms untouched<tag a="110" b="0" /></message>
