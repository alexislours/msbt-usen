I need to <anim id="Assent" target="actor" targetSpec="" />make the most of it!<pageBreak /><anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Though I have to admit that I don't
remember much from the last one,<delay20 />

this is the Year of the Rabbit!<delay40 />
I <anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />guess it's my year,<delay20 /> then?
<anim id="Worried" target="actor" targetSpec="" /><tag a="50" b="3" /><tag a="110" b="5" />,<delay20 /> I'm honestly not sure

I <anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />mostly just think<delay20 /> it's kinda funny.</message>
