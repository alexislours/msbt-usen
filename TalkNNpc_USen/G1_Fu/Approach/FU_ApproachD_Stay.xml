	<message label="002" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Pardon" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Remember what we talked about
before?<delay40 /> <anim id="Worried" target="actor" targetSpec="" />You know,<delay20 /> about how I was
thinking about leaving the island?
<anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Well,<delay20 /> after that,<delay20 /> I had a long talk
with <tag a="115" b="0" arg="0xcd00" /> about that,<delay40 />
<anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />and changed my mind!
<anim id="Hesitate" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I thought a lot about what each of
you said,<delay20 /> and I realized that I liked
being close to both of you.
<anim id="Sighing" target="actor" targetSpec="" />So now that that's been decided,<delay40 /> <anim id="FaintSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I'm
looking forward to spending more
time together,<delay20 /> <tag a="110" b="5" />.</message>

how told you<delay20 /> I was considering
moving away?
<anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Since then,<delay20 /> I've talked things out
with <tag a="115" b="0" arg="0xcd00" /> <anim id="BigSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />and decided
to stay.<pageBreak /><anim id="FaintSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I'm sorry for causing such a fuss<delay8 /><tag a="110" b="0" />
But I'm also glad <anim id="HappyFlower" target="actor" targetSpec="" />we can go on being
neighbors,<delay20 /> <tag a="110" b="5" />.</message>
	<message label="004" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Hesitate" target="actor" targetSpec="" />So<delay8 /><tag a="110" b="0" /> You know how I asked your
advice recently,<delay20 /> about whether
I should move to another island?
<anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Things have changed,<delay20 /> and<anim id="BigSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> I won't
be moving after all!<pageBreak /><anim id="Worried" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I feel a little bad about all this,<delay20 /> since
you were kind enough to listen<delay8 /> and
give me advice.
<anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Still,<delay20 /> <anim id="FaintSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I'm glad we can keep on being
here for each other,<delay20 /> <tag a="110" b="5" />.</message>
