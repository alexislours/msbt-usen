that's a cut above the rest? <delay20 /><anim id="Grin" target="actor" targetSpec="" />What
you need is the right fish.<pageBreak /><anim id="ShyBoy" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I mean, sure, it'll taste decent with
any old fish. <delay40 /><anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />But on Turkey Day,
"decent" ain't gonna cut it!
<anim id="AbsentMindedness" target="actor" targetSpec="" />What would get me drooling is some
kinda <colour id="1" />high-quality striped fish<colour id="65535" />. The
stripes are where the flavor is!</message>
