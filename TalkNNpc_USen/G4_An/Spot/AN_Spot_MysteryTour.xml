I don't know. <delay20 />I think I need to shake
things up, <tag a="110" b="5" />.<anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" /><pageBreak />Maybe a day on an empty-ish island

Honestly, I don't even know what half
these things are, <tag a="110" b="5" />.<pageBreak /><anim id="Grin" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Well, I'm not waiting. <delay20 />I'm grabbing up
everything I can carry. <delay20 />I can figure

start to take off<tag a="110" b="0" /><delay20 /><anim id="Serious" target="actor" targetSpec="" />and I panic.<pageBreak /><anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Yeah, turned out I left all my stuff for
this trip back at home, <tag a="110" b="5" />.<delay frames="40" />
<anim id="Eh" target="actor" targetSpec="" />But actually it's alright, because<tag a="110" b="0" /><pageBreak /><anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />A minute ago I asked that <colour id="3" />Wilbur <colour id="65535" />guy
if he had any tools I could borrow,<delay frames="40" />
<anim id="BigSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />and he whipped out a whole shop!<pageBreak /><anim id="Blushing" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Let this be a lesson—<delay20 />don't be like
