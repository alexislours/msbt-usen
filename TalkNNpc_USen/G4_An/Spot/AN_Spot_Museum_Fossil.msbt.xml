evolved from all the stuff in here?<delay frames="40" />
<anim id="Pardon" target="actor" targetSpec="" />That's wild!<pageBreak /><anim id="QuestionMark" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Do you think there are any distant

up inside rocks, anyhow? <delay20 />I've always

when the world was mostly water.<pageBreak /><anim id="QuestionMark" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Can you imagine what their world
must've been like?<delay frames="40" /> <anim id="Serious" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Besides wet,

are scary!<delay frames="40" /> <anim id="Shaking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I don't even know what
I'd do if I saw a living dinosaur<tag a="110" b="0" /><pageBreak /><anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Would I run? <delay20 />Would I just stand
there? <delay20 />Would I try to make friends

to life at night? <delay frames="40" />Seriously!<delay20 /> <anim id="Silent" target="actor" targetSpec="" />They
roam the island pruning the trees.<pageBreak /><anim id="Laughing" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Bwa ha ha! Yeah, <delay8 />no. <delay20 />That'd
be dumb.</message>

me of your dino-ways!"<pageBreak /><anim id="AbsentMindedness" target="actor" targetSpec="" />When I was little, I was ALL about
the dinosaurs.<delay frames="40" /> <anim id="Greeting" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I'd read every dino

what if they were floral patterned?</message>

be alive and running around, acting
all scary-like.<pageBreak /><anim id="FaintSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />In a way, it reminds me to try to live
in the here and now, y'know?<delay frames="40" /> <anim id="Scheming" target="actor" targetSpec="" />And to
also try to act a little less scary-like.</message>
	<message label="003_02" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Every fossil in here is tens of millions

young for a fossil!<pageBreak /><anim id="Greeting" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Makes me wonder what kinda
stuff from our time is gonna end
up fossilized, <tag a="110" b="5" />.</message>

really solid buddies.<pageBreak /><anim id="FaintSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I mean, I bet they weren't too hard
on each other.<pageBreak /><anim id="WrySmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />They seem like they were the
sedimental type.<pageBreak /><anim id="Grin" target="actor" targetSpec="" />But they probably had a lot
of backbone!<pageBreak /><anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />And a stone-cold stare.<pageBreak /><anim id="BigSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />They were also the real salt of
the earth.<pageBreak /><anim id="Laughing" target="actor" targetSpec="" />They really knew how to work that
rock-and-bone look too. <delay20 />I can't think
of a boulder style!<pageBreak /><anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Hang on, hang on! <delay20 />One more<tag a="110" b="0" /><pageBreak /><anim id="SmugFace" target="actor" targetSpec="" />All of 'em totally rocked!</message>

at fossils. <delay20 />But can you imagine how
much time THEY'VE seen?<pageBreak /><anim id="Greeting" target="actor" targetSpec="" />It kinda gets weird when I stare for
too long though.<delay frames="40" /> <anim id="Laughing" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I swear I think
they're moving sometimes.</message>

much,<delay frames="40" /> <anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />but they can be super cool

we'll be able to learn some stuff
about the fossils here.<pageBreak /><anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Plus we'll get to stick 'em on display.<delay frames="40" />

I'm learning TONS, <tag a="110" b="5" />!<pageBreak /><anim id="Grin" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I just can't believe how cool this
