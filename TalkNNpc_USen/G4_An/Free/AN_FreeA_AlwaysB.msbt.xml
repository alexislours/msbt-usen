my dad's awesome cooking. <delay20 />Dad
loved it, <tag a="110" b="5" />!<pageBreak /><anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />But I'd usually start after we ate, so

She's always so serious.<pageBreak /><anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Anyway, <delay20 />she reminds me of this
