today's an awesome chance to put
your agility training to the test.<pageBreak /><anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />There are eggs hidden EVERYWHERE.<delay20 />
Up in trees, <delay20 />in the river, <delay20 />you name it!</message>

to do all that dancing in his costume
without passing out from the heat.<pageBreak /><anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />He told me it wasn't a costume and

those Bunny Day candy eggs.<pageBreak /><anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />The rush is great for digging up a

But that sugar crash is brutal!</message>

earlier and spotted a weirdly colorful

there. <delay20 />Still<tag a="110" b="0" />I wonder what's inside.</message>

whole lot of <tag a="50" b="0" arg="0x400 0xcd03" />stone eggs, try going
on a <colour id="1" /><tag a="50" b="0" arg="0x100 0xcd03" />Nook Miles Ticket<colour id="65535" /> tour.<pageBreak /><anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" /><tag a="50" b="0" arg="0x400 0xcd03" />Stone eggs are like free-range free

AND help out your candy-egg hunt?<delay frames="40" />
<anim id="Hello" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Start hitting coconut trees.<pageBreak /><anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Coconut trees are extra stiff, so
you'll get a solid arm workout, <delay20 />plus
word is there's more eggs in 'em!</message>

earlier and ended up catching a
Bunny Day egg instead of a fish!<pageBreak /><anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />The egg still put up a serious fight
though, so I'm gonna count that as
my arm workout for the day.</message>
