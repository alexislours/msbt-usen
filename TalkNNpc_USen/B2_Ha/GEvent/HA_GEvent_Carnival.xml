up everyone is today, huh? <delay20 />You gotta
love Festivale!<pageBreak /><anim id="Negative" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Morning-jog energy levels won't cut
it today. <delay20 />If you're not sweating,
you're not doing it right!</message>

air.<delay20 /> If you see a feather float by, grab
your net and swing for the fences!<pageBreak /><anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I'm challenging myself to a feather-
catching contest. <delay20 />So far, I'm in the
lead, but I'm right on my tail!</message>

some trading, <tag a="110" b="5" />.</message>
	<message label="005" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Flashy outfits help you stand out,
which means more eyes on your
rippling abs. <delay20 />No complaints here.<pageBreak /><anim id="ShyBoy" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Nothing to stop you from wearing it
every day either. <delay20 />It's always a good
time for dance cardio, <tag a="110" b="5" />!</message>

Needless to say<tag a="110" b="0" /><delay20 />I'm rocking it.</message>

It's easy to get distracted, but don't

Today's Festivale, so you've gotta
dance like you're lifting weights!<pageBreak /><anim id="ShyBoy" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I don't exactly know what that
means, but do that today, and your
hamstrings will thank you tomorrow.</message>

I've been on the lookout, but so far,
no luck, <tag a="110" b="5" />.<pageBreak /><anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Whenever I spot one, I do a victory
dance, grab my net, and<tag a="110" b="0" /><delay20 />it's gone.<delay20 />
I should really work on my approach.</message>
	<message label="010" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Dance" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Check out my dance moves!<delay20 />
My footwork is superb, and my
musculature speaks for itself.
<anim id="HappyDance" target="actor" targetSpec="" />The plan is to dance all day long.<delay20 />
See if you can keep up! <delay20 />It'll be
fun, <tag a="110" b="5" />!</message>

and dancing<tag a="110" b="0" /><delay20 /><anim id="BigSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> Festivale makes for an
amazing workout!
<anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Trying to spot the feathers pumps up
your eyes too. <delay20 />Eye muscles are a

dance until my feet fall off. <delay20 />Or maybe
just until I hit my step-count target.<pageBreak /><anim id="HappyFlower" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Follow me, and we'll get this island
groovin'! <delay20 />No better time than now!</message>

Nighttime is when the champs
come out to play!<pageBreak /><anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I've still got plenty in the tank, so
if you need some fitspiration, look
no further.</message>
	<message label="016" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="HappyFlower" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Everyone's dancing their hearts out.<delay20 />
You can almost smell their effort
from in here!<pageBreak /><anim id="Frantic" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Oh no<tag a="110" b="0" /><delay20 /> Now that effort's all up in
my nose, I'm finding it hard to

be sure to rest now and then.<pageBreak /><anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />After all, Festivale is more of a
marathon than a sprint. <delay20 />That means
you've gotta pace yourself!</message>

Coach, I want you to know it's
important to take breaks.<pageBreak /><anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Use that time to work on posing.<delay20 />
If you don't nail the poses, your
dancing will suffer. <delay20 /><anim id="Shocked" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Your gains too!</message>
