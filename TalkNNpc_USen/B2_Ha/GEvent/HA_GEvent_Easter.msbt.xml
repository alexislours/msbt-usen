today's an awesome chance to put
your agility training to the test.<pageBreak /><anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />There are eggs hidden EVERYWHERE.<delay20 />
Up in trees, <delay20 />in the river, <delay20 />you name it!</message>
	<message label="002" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I tried asking <colour id="3" />Zipper<colour id="65535" /> how he trained
to do all that dancing in his costume
without passing out from the heat.<pageBreak /><anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />He told me it wasn't a costume and
to quit asking, <tag a="110" b="5" />.</message>
	<message label="003" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Negative" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I gotta be more careful about eating
those Bunny Day candy eggs.<pageBreak /><anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />The rush is great for digging up a
tree or getting some extra reps in<tag a="110" b="0" /><anim id="Sleepy" target="actor" targetSpec="" /><delay frames="40" />
But that sugar crash is brutal!</message>
	<message label="011" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Serious" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I saw one of those colorful balloons
floating by.<delay frames="40" /> <anim id="Negative" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Even with my world-class
vertical leap I still couldn't reach it.<pageBreak /><anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I really want to see one up close
though<tag a="110" b="0" /><delay20 /> Maybe I could shoot one
down somehow, <tag a="110" b="5" />?</message>
	<message label="012" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I was doing aerobics on the beach
earlier and spotted a weirdly colorful
message bottle, <tag a="110" b="5" />.<pageBreak /><anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Opening bottles and jars is below my
weight class though, so I just left it
there. <delay20 />Still<tag a="110" b="0" />I wonder what's inside.</message>
	<message label="102" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Grin" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Bunny Day is the best. <delay20 />I mean, I get
<tag a="50" b="0" arg="0x400 0xcd03" />stone eggs just for hitting the rocks
around here?<delay frames="40" /> <anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I do that all the time!<pageBreak /><anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Oh, pro-tip!<delay20 /> <anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />If you wanna find a
whole lot of <tag a="50" b="0" arg="0x400 0xcd03" />stone eggs, try going
on a <colour id="1" /><tag a="50" b="0" arg="0x100 0xcd03" />Nook Miles Ticket<colour id="65535" /> tour.<pageBreak /><anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" /><tag a="50" b="0" arg="0x400 0xcd03" />Stone eggs are like free-range free
weights,<delay20 /><anim id="Laughing" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> and those islands are the
freest range there is, <tag a="110" b="5" />!</message>
	<message label="103" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="Grin" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Want a tip that'll get you ripped
AND help out your candy-egg hunt?<delay frames="40" />
<anim id="Hello" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Start hitting coconut trees.<pageBreak /><anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Coconut trees are extra stiff, so
you'll get a solid arm workout, <delay20 />plus
word is there's more eggs in 'em!</message>
	<message label="106" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="QuestionMark" target="actor" targetSpec="" />You been fishing lately? <delay20 />I went out
earlier and ended up catching a
Bunny Day egg instead of a fish!<pageBreak /><anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />The egg still put up a serious fight
though, so I'm gonna count that as
my arm workout for the day.</message>
