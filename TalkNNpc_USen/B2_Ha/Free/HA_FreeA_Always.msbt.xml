your bod, <delay20 />you gotta remember that
muscles need to rest.<pageBreak /><anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />So if you spend a bunch of time on
your arms, <delay20 />give them a day or two to
recover before hitting 'em again.<pageBreak /><anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />If you make sure to pace yourself,<delay20 />
you'll feel better,<delay frames="40" /> <anim id="BigSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />AND you'll have

hard to maintain, right?<pageBreak /><anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Walking or some other light exercise
can be a good substitute on days
when you're busy with other stuff.<pageBreak /><anim id="Confused" target="actor" targetSpec="" />But be sure you wear socks, 'cause
you could get blisters or chafed skin
if you don't, <tag a="110" b="5" />.
<anim id="ShyBoy" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Then again,<delay20 /> once you're at my level,<delay20 />
your calluses will be so thick you

with low reps and heavier weights.<pageBreak /><anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />If you want to tone your muscles,<delay20 /> do
more reps with lighter weights.<pageBreak /><anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />These are the basics of the
<tag a="110" b="10" />-style system.<pageBreak /><anim id="FaintSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Maybe aim for 30 reps per day for
heavy or light weights, <tag a="110" b="5" />.<delay20 />
That should work for ya!</message>

programs,<delay20 /> but the most important
thing is consistency, <tag a="110" b="5" />.
<anim id="FaintSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Visualize the bod you want to have
and go after it.<pageBreak /><anim id="AbsentMindedness" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Six-pack abs<tag a="110" b="0" /><delay20 /> Bulging biceps<tag a="110" b="0" /><delay20 />
