<colour id="1" />DIY demo sessions <colour id="65535" />over at his
place, <tag a="110" b="6" />?<pageBreak /><anim id="Explain" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I went by and he helped me make
some tools out of stuff we found
around the island.<pageBreak /><anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />They're kinda subpar<tag a="110" b="0" />but the demo
gave me a ton of ideas for some
workout gear I can build.<pageBreak /><anim id="FaintSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I bet you could make a lot of really
sweet stuff with <colour id="1" />DIY<colour id="65535" />.<delay20 /> The demo is
free too.<delay frames="40" /> <anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Go talk to <colour id="3" />Tom Nook<colour id="65535" />!</message>

wing it, and then kinda sorta moved
here without a Bell to my name.<pageBreak /><anim id="Laughing" target="actor" targetSpec="" />So now I'm trying to set up my
routine and, well<tag a="110" b="0" /><delay frames="40" /><anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />bottom line
is, I'm ultra broke.<pageBreak /><anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Hmm<tag a="110" b="0" /> I could do some weeding,
or pick stuff up and sell it to <colour id="3" />Timmy<colour id="65535" />.<delay20 />
That might help, <tag a="110" b="5" /><tag a="110" b="0" /></message>

Oh, except for in the plaza!<pageBreak /><anim id="AbsentMindedness" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I'm thinking of putting together an

his place and he can sell you more.<pageBreak /><anim id="FaintSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Say what you like, but this island life

I'll probably be selling more stuff to
