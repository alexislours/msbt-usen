we have a serious showdown
with the fishies!
<anim id="Pardon" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Now listen. You can't just pull the
rod back with all your might. <delay40 /><anim id="Serious" target="actor" targetSpec="" />You
have to outwit the fish!<pageBreak /><anim id="OhGeez" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Of course<tag a="110" b="0" />I tell myself that, but I
end up pulling as hard as I can<delay40 /><anim id="Laughing" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> and
the fish swims away, <tag a="110" b="6" />!</message>

catch, the more prizes you get<tag a="110" b="0" /><pageBreak /><anim id="BigSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />If you're going to go for a prize,
you might as well go for the

Tourney makes me get serious about
it.<delay frames="40" /><anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> I'm in full-on visualization mode.<pageBreak /><anim id="Thinking" target="actor" targetSpec="" />After you settled up with <colour id="3" />C.J.<colour id="65535" />,<delay frames="40" /> <anim id="HappyDance" target="actor" targetSpec="" />you
can just let your muscles take over

Fishing Tourney, you have to
talk to <colour id="3" />C.J. <colour id="65535" />in the plaza, OK?
<anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Then all you have to do is fish like
mad, collect points, and get some
swag!<delay frames="40" /> <anim id="HappyDance" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I'm pumped now!</message>

catching fish within a time limit!<pageBreak /><anim id="AbsentMindedness" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Waiting, your muscles tensed<tag a="110" b="0" />then
the float drops and you pull as hard
as your biceps'll let you.<pageBreak /><anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />You can't beat a flex-off against a
fish. <delay20 />But then it's done, and it's on
to the next.<delay frames="40" /> <anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />So good, <tag a="110" b="5" />!</message>
