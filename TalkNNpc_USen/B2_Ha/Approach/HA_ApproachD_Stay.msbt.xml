thinking about leaving?<delay frames="40" /> <anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Well,
I decided to stay.
<anim id="ShyBoy" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I ended up having a chat with

I stopped worrying.<pageBreak /><anim id="BigSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I mean,<delay20 /> you and I still haven't figured
out who's tougher yet<tag a="110" b="0" /><delay frames="40" /><anim id="Greeting" target="actor" targetSpec="" />and that's
just unsettling.</message>
	<message label="002" attrib="00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"><anim id="EmotEnd" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I know I talked to you about me
leaving the island, <delay20 /><anim id="Negative" target="actor" targetSpec="" />but I just
couldn't go through with it.
<anim id="Blushing" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I had a heart-to-heart chat with
<tag a="115" b="0" arg="0xcd00" /> and we decided
that I'm needed here.
<anim id="Laughing" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I bet you thought you were going to
be able to take it easy, <tag a="110" b="5" />!</message>

leaving <tag a="110" b="8" /> a while
back?<delay frames="40" /> <anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />Well, chuck that idea.
<anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />After talking to you,<delay20 /> I had a chat with

the other day about leaving the
island?<delay frames="40" /><anim id="Negative" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> Yeah, I scrapped that idea.
<anim id="Smiling" target="actor" targetSpec="" />After our chat, I started thinking
about it, and I just don't have

<anim id="Nodding" target="actor" targetSpec="" />I mean, we still need to figure out
which of us is tougher.<delay frames="40" /><anim id="FaintSmile" target="actor" targetSpec="" /> So get used
to seeing a lot more of me!</message>
